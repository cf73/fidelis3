  Hi Marc, I just want to say thank you.  My McIntosh paired with the Sonus Faber Sonetta speakers have amazing, incredible, and stunning sound.  I am glad to have revamped my entire sound system at your store from my Rega P3 turntable to my acoustics and everything between.  The internet is great for information and research but having your store to listen to speakers or borrowing a McIntosh amp to hear it in my system before purchase is the best.  I am thrilled and love the sound of my music.  I am glad you are in business.  Maybe I will check out more soon.  I just wanted to say thanks.
  Frederick
