title: 'My system has never sounded better.'
testimonial: |-
  This is a quick note to say I could not be happier with my sales experience following yesterday’s first-time visit to your shop. I purchased a Hana SL cartridge and was fortunate enough to have it mounted while I waited. 
  While I appreciate the unit will be burning-in for a while, I couldn’t wait to reach out and let you know I’m floored with the improvements in dynamics, tonal accuracy and soundstage. My system has never sounded better. 

  Thank you once again. 
  Great job, guys. 

  Phil
