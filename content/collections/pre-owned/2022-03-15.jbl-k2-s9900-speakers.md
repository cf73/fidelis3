        text: "JBL K2 S9900 speakers in wood grain finish. Speakers are in excellent overall condition and sound spectacular. There are a couple of\_ (very minor) scuffs/minor scratches on the side/back and a couple of unfortunate dings on the top/back edge of one speaker (see photo). These all could likely be touched up from someone familiar with woodworking/refinishing. The speakers sell as new for $48,400.00. We have no boxes and packing so these will need to be a local sale with pick-up.\_"
