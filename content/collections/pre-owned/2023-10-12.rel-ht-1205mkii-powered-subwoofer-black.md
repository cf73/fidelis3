        text: 'HT/1205 MKII establishes a new performance standard for affordable home theatre subwoofers. Avoiding electronic gimmickry in favor of properly balanced priorities; cabinets that are right-sized, solidly braced and beautifully finished. A sparkling new amp design that effortlessly delivers 500W into an all-new CarbonGlas™ 12” (300mm) driver. The sexy new black lacquer top plate has a subtle REL logo floating on top, while the expensively wrought black line-grained composite for the cabinet looks the business.'

        text: 'HT/1205 MKII plays 50% louder than its predecessor, while also delivering more precision and subtlety. It is capable of output levels more commonly found in models well over $1,000/£1,000. Fantastic for music and available HT-Air rounds out a perfect offering.'
