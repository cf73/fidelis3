        text: 'The active design of the G Five removes the need for bulky external power amplifiers, since the amplifier is contained within the speaker cabinet itself. Not only does this give you high quality internal amplifiers that are totally optimised for the drivers they are feeding, but it also means that you can simply hook up your sound source directly to the G Five for clean, uncompromised performance. And with our simple room compensation switches, the G Five will adapt to your acoustic environment - delivering pure and truthful sound wherever you choose to listen.'
