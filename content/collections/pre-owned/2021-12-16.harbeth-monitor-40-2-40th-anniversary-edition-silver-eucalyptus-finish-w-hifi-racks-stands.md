description: '<p>Harbeth Monitor 40.2 40th Anniversary Edition, Silver Eucalyptus Finish w/HiFi Racks Stands. Speakers are in excellent physical and functional condition with original boxes and packing. Harbeth''s flagship speaker - capable of conveying the scale and scope of a full orchestra or the tonal richness of a solo vintage violin. The 40th anniversary edition speakers offered improved internal wiring, premium binding post as well as upgraded crossover parts to reach the pinnacle of performance. Sold as new for over $20,000.00 (with stands) and the current XD version in premium finish sells for $24,500.00 without stands. These are highly sought after and won''t last long!&nbsp; Shipping will be calculated after the sale as these need to go via a freight service and strapped to a pallet for safe travels.&nbsp;</p>'
