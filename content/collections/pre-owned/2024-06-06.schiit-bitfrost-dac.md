        text: 'Just like our range-topping Yggdrasil, the Bifrost 2/64 features a fully hardware balanced architecture. This means four 16-bit DACs total, with one DAC for each phase. You can expect the same stellar performance from both the XLR and RCA outputs, so Bifrost 2/64 works seamlessly with your system.'

        text: 'Like all Schiit True Multibit products, Bifrost 2/64 uses completely unique D/A converters and our proprietary time- and frequency-domain optimized digital filter. In the case of Bifrost 2/64, four DAC8812 D/A converters—the same basic chip used in Yggdrasil Less is More—do the conversion, while the digital filter is implemented on an Analog Devices SHARC DSP. You can also choose non-oversampling mode (NOS) to bypass the digital filter entirely.'

Compare this to other DACs, even DACs costing many times more—only Bifrost 2/64 provides complete hardware and firmware upgradability. All original Bifrost 2s can be upgraded to 2/64 with a new card and firmware, available on our Upgrades page.'

        text: "By “designed and built in California\" this is what we mean: the vast majority of the total production cost of Bifrost 2/64—chassis, boards, transformers, assembly, etc—goes to US companies manufacturing in the US. Our chassis are made minutes from our facility. Our PCBs are done just over the hill from us. Our transformers are also made in California. We ain’t just putting in the last screws and calling it done.\_\_"
