        text: 'Rogers LS 3/5A speakers in perfect working condition. The Rosewood cabinets are in good overall condition with a few minor dings, but there is one corner that was damaged and filled in with some type of wood filler or Bondo. Speakers sold as new for $1,000.00. There is a cult following around this classic model due to its superb midrange, smooth high frequencies and great imaging. The 15 ohm impedance is perfect for a tubed amplifier. The new version of the model sells for $5,000.00!'
