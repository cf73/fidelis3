        text: 'The Stellar Power Plant 3 stands on the shoulders of giants. Built as an evolution from our renowned P12, P15, and P20 the P3 is our most affordable regenerator – perfect for powering sources and small to medium systems. Power Plants generate sine-wave-perfect, regulated, high current AC power from your home’s AC. Problems on your power line such as low voltage, distorted waveforms, sagging power, and noise are eliminated and the power quality enhanced. The Stellar P3 PowerPlant provides greatly improved performance and safety from just plugging into the wall socket, along with far better dynamics, more authoritative bass, and a much bigger, more open soundstage than any passive power conditioner on the market.'

        text: 'The P3 is the perfect companion for improving system performance and ensuring a safe environment for you Hi-Fi system. Providing 300 watts of continuous power output and peaks of 1000 watts, the P3 is just right for source gear or an entire systems running small to medium class AB amps or larger high-efficiency Class D amps like the Stellar M700 monoblocks. The P3 will bring forth all that''s possible from your HiFi system, ensuring you get the same great performance every time you listen.'

        text: 'The P3 takes in your home''s noisy, distorted, and unregulated AC and outputs pure and perfect power that dramatically enhances sound quality. It does this by rebuilding the AC, lowering output impedance, and regulating the voltage. Low output impedance is critical to maintaining a dynamic presentation. Powering equipment through a passive power conditioner only worsens the problem and should be avoided. The Power Plant, on the other hand, has such low output impedance (0.008Ω vs. typical 0.4Ω) that even the hungriest of amplifiers won’t be starved for clean AC power. When your amp is asked to produce loud orchestral levels, you want to make sure it has all the power it needs and only a Power Plant provides a constant output regardless of the dynamic demands of equipment or your neighbors. Power Plants also generate new waveforms that enhance the capabilities of your equipment. MultiWave extends the peak charging time of the sine wave so connected equipment has more energy storage and less power supply ripple. The results are dramatic: a bigger more musically accurate soundstage than with a simple sine wave.'
