        text: 'The F1-8 loudspeaker distils the same technology and expertise utilised in its floorstanding siblings, into a smaller standmount format. The hand crafted cabinet is supported on a machined aluminium plinth that houses Fyne’s state of the art BassTrax LF diffuser. Surrounded by FyneFlute rubber surround, the F1-8 features a 200mm IsoFlare low frequency driver mated to a 25mm magnesium dome compression tweeter to create a point source, time aligned transducer delivering pure isotropic radiation across the entire audio spectrum. Hand finished at Fyne Audio’s UK manufacturing facility in stunning real walnut veneer with burr walnut inlay, the F1-8 represents the pinnacle of Hi-Fi UK loudspeaker design in stand-mount speaker format.'
