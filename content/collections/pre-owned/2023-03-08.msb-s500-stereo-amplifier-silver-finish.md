        text: 'The world’s leading DACs needed an amplifier to match. The result was a clean slate design that could meet our DAC’s ultra high dynamic range head on. With the amplifier’s architecture optimized in critical areas, audio performance, longevity, and an ability to drive any speaker became our principal design parameters. We redefined the idea of what an amplifier can be, embedding the S500 with a fully modular design alongside a 1.0 Farad Power Core, a matched impedance input stage and an all billet CNC case. The finest amplifier we’ve ever created, the 500 series redefines excellence and sets a new bar in the industry.'

        text: 'The S500 features a discrete design featuring a class A matched impedance input stage. This result is a product with minimized signal reflections, input noise, and distortion while also maximizing power transfer and dynamic range in a zero negative feedback design. With custom low-noise high-current toroidal transformers and rugged high-current output buffers, the S500 provides a transparent, holographic listening experience that’s completely fatigue free. All components were meticulously chosen for their sonic performance and longevity, ensuring your amplifier is built to last.'
