        text: 'The DirectStream P15 Power Plant is the gold standard for safety, reliability, and high-performance AC power regeneration. The P15 improves micro and macro dynamics, audio purity, instrumental separation, soundstage width and depth, and lowers background noise for any connected equipment. From medium to large power amplifiers to the smallest pieces of source equipment, the P15 will work magic on your system’s performance. Don’t starve your music or risk damaging your equipment. A P15 gives you greatly improved performance and safety from just plugging into the wall socket and far better dynamics, bass and a much bigger, open soundstage than any power conditioner on the market.'

        text: 'The DirectStream Power Plant 15 is the next generation of AC power regeneration. It has 5 separate regenerated zones, buss bar delivery system, and 1500 watts of pure regenerated power. From medium to large power amplifiers to the smallest pieces of source equipment, the P15 will work magic on your system’s performance. Expect far better micro and macro dynamics as well as a cleaner, lower noise background. Power regeneration uses active components, like those found in large, powerful audio amplifiers, to rebuild the AC power and produce clean, clear, distortion-free, regulated AC to the equipment. The results are dramatic: unrestrained dynamics even under the loudest passages, an open, wide soundstage that does not collapse with volume and a naturalness to the music that is remarkable. The 7-inch, full color display on the front panel of the P15 allows you to measure distortion, both incoming and outgoing, improvement levels, and power consumption. You can also adjust your settings, such as the turn on/off sequence and the output voltage, as well as turn individual zones on or off, and measure the power quality with either the built-in oscilloscope or the THD analyzer.'
