        text: '1 - pair of Pass Labs Aleph 2 amplifiers. These are an iconic design from Nelson Pass and this pair is in near perfect condition with original boxes and packing. 100 watts of pure/sweet, single-ended, Class-A sound. You won''t find many examples this clean and these will easily outperform many modern amplifiers costing 3-4 times as much!'
