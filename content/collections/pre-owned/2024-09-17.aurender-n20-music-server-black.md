        text: "N20 sits in the enviable “sweet spot” of cost vs. performance in the middle of Aurender's range of digital source components. Equally at home in a cost-no-object system or as the cornerstone of a more modest system, N20 is designed to be connected to the world's best high-quality DACs. the N20 features ultra high-end SPDIF (Coaxial, BNC, Optical) and AES/EBU outputs in addition to an isolated USB Audio output. The SPDIF digital output suite is controlled by a precise OCXO clock for long-term jitter reduction, achieving the perfect marriage of low noise and low jitter. A word clock or master clock input is also provided for users who wish to sync with an external clock. High-resolution file support for all major codecs goes to the extreme limits, and on-the-fly DSD-to-PCM conversion by FPGA is available for SPDIF outputs. N20 is equipped with two user-installable storage bays, allowing the user to select the drive type and capacity to meet their own needs. The handsome machined aluminum front panel features a large 8.8” full-color IPS LCD display that reproduces the album art, artist name and song title."
