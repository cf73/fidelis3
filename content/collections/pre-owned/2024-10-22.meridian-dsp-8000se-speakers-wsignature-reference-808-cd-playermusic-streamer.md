        text: 'Built by hand in the UK, Meridian have designed and engineered the DSP8000SE to deliver maximum resonance and control. The cabinet comprises of two discrete enclosures with a dedicated bass section and a separate head-assembly for the midrange and high-frequency drive-units. The two enclosures are decoupled from each other by custom spikes and cups. The custom-designed midrange unit and three pairs of horizontally opposed bass-drivers feature anodized aluminium clamp rings to minimize resonance.'
