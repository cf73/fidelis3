        text: 'Krell''s XD upgrade for the iBias amplifiers takes an already great sounding amplifier and raises its performance to the next level. The XD stands for ''Xtended Dynamics, Dimensionality, and Detail'' and is a classic example of Krell''s continuous R&D efforts reaping benefits across multiple product lines. During the development of the K-300i Integrated Amplifier, Krell discovered substantial sonic improvements by lowering the output impedance below traditional norms. When applying this technique to its existing line of amplifiers, the improvement was so substantial, it earned its own, unique designation — XD.'

        text: 'It was no simple matter lowering the output impedance. This affects the amplifier''s stability and transient response. Each stage prior to the output stage had to be re-tuned to work optimally with the lower output impedance. This lower output impedance exerts more control over the speaker drivers, and damps out unwanted vibrational modes, allowing a more accurate reproduction of the original signal.'

        text: 'Power supply technology has always been an important contributor to the Krell sound. The power supplies of Krell iBias Class A amplifiers have been optimized for use with the iBias circuit. Depending on the model, up to four toroidal transformers feed amplifier modules that include the audio circuitry, rectifier, and power supply filtering mounted to an individual heat sink. This design shortens the electrical path from the power supply to the output transistors, reducing the overall impedance and allowing the circuit to respond faster and control the speakers even better and more accurately.'

        text: 'Unlike traditional Class A amplifiers, iBias Class A amps have a compact design that allows rack-mounting, making them ideal for custom installation as well as traditional audiophile systems. This convenient form factor is made possible through thermostatically controlled ventilation fans. The fans used are specifically chosen for quiet operation and operate at the speed required to maintain the ideal internal temperature. They run only during periods of peak energy demand – when the music is at its loudest – so they are inaudible in normal use.'

Normally used in demanding, high-bandwidth video circuits, these transistors allow the design of gain stages with superb accuracy and very low distortion. The signal path is fully complementary and fully balanced from input to output. Independent complementary pre driver and driver stages for the positive and negative output transistors make the output stages extremely fast and linear. This unique circuit is impervious to low-impedance or reactive loads. It simply drives any loudspeaker with absolute confidence, achieving the very best possible sonic results.'

        text: 'Most amplifiers use coupling capacitors in the signal path to block DC and prevent damaging offset voltages from reaching your speakers. Krell amplifiers are fully direct-coupled, with no capacitors in the audio signal path. This design gives the Krell amplifiers lower internal impedance, which allows firmer, more precise control of your speakers. It also provides flatter, more extended low-frequency response, because coupling capacitors not only block DC but also affect the lowest bass frequencies. Krell employs expensive, nonintrusive DC servos that remove DC without impacting the musical signal. Thus, the iBias Class A amplifiers deliver the full breadth of the music with detail, impact and space intact.'
