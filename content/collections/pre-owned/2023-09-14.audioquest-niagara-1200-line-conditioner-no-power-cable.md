        text: "Featuring an additional high-current AC outlet (two total), comprehensive surge-protection abilities, and a substantial 15-pound weight to complement its textured bright finish, the AudioQuest Niagara 1200 Low-Z Power Noise-Dissipation System can sit on a shelf or rack – just like a component – with all of the cables running in and out from the back. And it can also be used vertically or on its side, in case you need to wedge it between furniture and a wall.\_Most importantly, Niagara 1200 remains an overachieving power conditioner that gives you a proper power solution for a bit less of a jolt to the pocket book."

Plus,\_Niagara 1200 protects itself – no damage, no down time.\_Set it and forget it."

        text: 'Inside, AudioQuest filled Niagara 1200 with ultra-linear AC RF filtering capacitors, two banks of direction-controlled ground-noise dissipation, and low-impedance AC inlet and outlet contact with hanging-silver plating over high-purity beryllium copper for superior noise dissipation. In addition to providing enhanced linearity and clearer detail from your music, it offers over-voltage shutdown and more than 18 octaves of AC differential filtering with linear response. And it remains manageable in even small rooms. The rather slim (19.35" W x 3.55" H x 7.50" D) form factor gives you tremendous convenience. And complete reassurance.'

        text: 'Designed by Garth Powell, and outfitted with AudioQuest''s Ground-Noise Dissipation System and Ultra-Linear Noise-Dissipation Technology, Niagara 1200 embodies the very same design philosophy and incorporates the same patented technology found in its larger and much more expensive sibling, Niagara 7000. Much like the later, Niagara 1200 uses ultra-low-resistance solid-core wiring optimized for low-noise directionality; capacitor forming technologies that vastly improve linearity and minimize distortion; and low-impedance AC inlet and outlet contacts with heavy silver plating over high-purity beryllium copper for superior noise dissipation. Similarly, Niagara 1200 features AudioQuest''s non-sacrificial surge protection (to withstand multiple AC surges and spikes up to 6000V), Zero Ground-Contamination Technology, and over-voltage shutdown to ensure that your A/V systems are thoroughly protected from AC surges and spikes.'
