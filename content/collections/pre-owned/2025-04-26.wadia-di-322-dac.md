        text: 'The di322 digital audio decoder keeps Wadia at the forefront of digital music playback by adding expanded support for high fidelity DSD files to the Wadia line. Via the USB input, the di322 supports DSD64, DSD128 and DSD256 music files. PCM files with sampling rates up to 32-bit/384kHz – including DXD 352.8kHz and DXD 384kHz formats – can also be played through the USB input. With the addition of DSD support, digital music lovers can experience and enjoy some of the latest high resolution music offerings. Its 2 optical and 2 coaxial inputs accept music with resolutions up to 24-bit/192kHz, while the DIN input will allow future Wadia models to connect to the di322 at high performance levels.'

        text: "\"It took me all of about ten seconds to realize that the di322 sounded fuller and warmer than the DAC that had preceded it in my system...\_I was already enjoying [Adele's] “Hello” when, at 1:06, the chorus began. I was shocked at the weight of the piano notes I was hearing... Seemingly because of this weight, the soundstage expanded to the point where it was bigger than the room -- the piano’s lower registers created as much room lock as if I’d added a perfectly integrated subwoofer to a bass-shy speaker system...\_With all manner of pop or rock music, the di322 was a fun-filled ride...\_Its sound was full, big, and played deep -- deep bass, deep soundstage, wide dynamic range...\_You’ll get your money’s worth here, and then some.\" Winner of a Reviewers' Choice Award\_-"
