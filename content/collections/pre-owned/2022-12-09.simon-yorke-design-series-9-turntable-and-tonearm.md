        text: 'Simon Yorke Design Series 9 Turntable & Tonearm. Unit is in good physical and functional condition with original box, packing and accessories. Metal work is showing a little aging and could use a good polishing, but otherwise very well cared for. Original Sounds of Silence cartridge is installed, but not guaranteed to work as it is older and with a number of ours on it. '
