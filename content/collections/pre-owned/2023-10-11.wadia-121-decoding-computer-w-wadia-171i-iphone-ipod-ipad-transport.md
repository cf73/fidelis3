        text: 'The 171i is called a transport. According to the Wadia site, a transport is the digital link between a media source such as an iPod, a computer, or a musical disc, and your home audio system. What it does, basically, is to make it possible to connect your iPhone/iPod/iPad to your stereo and provide ir remote control along the way. Its special trick though, the one that sets it aside from other such devices, it its ability to extract the digital signal straight from the i-device whereas formerly it was only possible to extract analog audio. Needless to say, the iPod/iPhone/iPad’s built in DAC''s are fine, but no match for a proper audio player and the resultant sound from the analog output does indeed lack dynamics, color, substance and is generally just not up to scratch. The digital signal on the other hand promises bit-accurate sound output and this is why the Wadia Transport is said to rival some top performing digital source components.'
