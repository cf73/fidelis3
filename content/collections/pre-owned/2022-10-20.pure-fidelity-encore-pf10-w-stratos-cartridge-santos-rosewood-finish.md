        text: 'The Encore not only unlocks the uncanny beauty of vinyl music reproduction, but it also delivers phenomenal value. It starts with our “hybrid” design, which combines the best characteristics of high-mass, low-mass and suspended turntables. We back it up with proven materials, thorough engineering and high-precision fabrication. Listen to the Encore and you’ll hear solid bass, subtle midrange timbres and satisfying, fast transients on the likes of cymbal hits. And you’ll want to hear all your LPs, all over again.'
