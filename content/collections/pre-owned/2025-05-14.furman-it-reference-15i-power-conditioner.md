        text: 'For over 40 years, Furman has pioneered the development of AC power products for the most demanding audio, video, and broadcast professionals. Though the need for pristine AC power is nothing new, the IT-REFERENCE 15i’s technology and its unique implementation are revolutionary and without peer.'

        text: 'The extreme AC demands encountered in the professional audio/ video arena have required technological developments far in excess of typical home theater/audiophile power products. In studios, live sound, and broadcast facilities, breakdown is unacceptable. Equipment failure or poor performance is costly. The same is true of today’s home theater. Our solution-based technology, extensive engineering expertise, and robust build quality have answered the challenge of today’s corrupted power lines, and led to the creation of the IT-REFERENCE 15i.'

        text: 'Today’s AC lines are plagued with ever increasing noise. When AC noise couples into your system’s critical components, it masks low level signals and cripples performance. This low level content is critical because it relays the crucial harmonics and ambience in audio, and the depth and clarity in video. With Furman’s exclusive Linear Filtering Technology, CD players, pre-amplifiers, satellite receivers, and scalers are fed linearly-filtered AC power. This dramatically reduces noise, ensuring consistent peak operation regardless of load conditions or the time of the day. For the first time, you will see and hear your theater or audio system as it should be — uncompromised.'

        text: 'Further, our Discrete Symmetrical Power features total isolation between the filtered-high current outlets, and the isolated symmetrical power AC outlet banks. This positively breaks noise-inducing ground loops, hum bars, and power supply backwash between critical interconnected equipment, all without compromising electrical safety. Furman’s newly refined Dual-Screen Transformers yield the widest bandwidth of noise-reduction possible. This enables the IT-Reference 15i to uncover unprecedented levels of video and audio detail, while insuring that plasmas, LCD screens, or video projectors are free of AC ground contamination from an audio processor or power amplifiers.'

This assures the highest level of AC protection possible, without sacrificing itself when the offending surge is severe — no damaged equipment, no service calls, no down time.'

With this technology, low-level analog, digital, and video components are not modulated or distorted via the power amplifier’s extreme AC current demands. Instead, the power amplifier sees a highly filtered, extremely low-impedance supply of AC power.'

This technology enables power amplifiers and powered subwoofers to operate at peak efficiency and reach levels of performance previously unattainable.'

Video presentation will be crisp and colors true with greater gray and black scale definition, as well as noticeably improved depth and clarity. Sonic transients will be startlingly fast with bass fundamentals that shake foundations with their weight and visceral impact. Mid and high frequencies will bloom with sweet, non-glaring ease while imaging improves dramatically, all the while remaining true to your system’s inherent virtues.'
