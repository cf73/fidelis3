        text: 'Classic Marantz Model 7 Tubed Preamplifier w/reproduction case. Unit is in very good physical (faceplate is near perfect) and excellent functional condition and has been gone through by a qualified service technician. All controls work well with no noise or drop outs from knobs or switches. This is a coveted design by Saul Marantz from 1958 and still has an enticingly musical sound by modern standards. '

        text: 'The Model 7 was a breakthrough in preamplifier design at its introduction in 1958. Largely engineered by Saul Marantz, the Model 7 offered dual phono inputs, two tuner inputs, and in a stroke of prescience, a “TV” input. In 1958. The front panel featured an array of four knobs on each side flanking four toggle switches. The right-side knobs provided independent bass and treble adjustment for each channel. The left-side knobs allowed source selection, volume, balance, and stereo/mono modes. The center toggle switches were tape monitor, a three-position phono equalization switch (78, Columbia, RIAA), and high- and low-pass filters. Minimalism in preamplifier design had clearly not yet taken hold.'

        text: 'The model number was not on the front panel, just the inscription “Marantz Stereo Console,” with the word “Stereo” in fancy script. The front-panel layout was created by Mr. Marantz, who had a background in drafting, graphic arts, and industrial design.'

        text: 'The circuit was based on three 12AX7s per channel. The phono stage was particularly innovative in its three-stage circuit, which was soon dubbed “the Marantz circuit.” Phono gain was 64.5dB (22.5dB line). The frequency response was 20Hz–20kHz +/- 0.5dB. Noise was -80dB with a 10mV phono input. The unit weighed 20 pounds.'

        text: 'In production for more than 12 years, the Model 7 was the most popular preamplifier of its time, with sales of more than 130,000 units—a staggering number considering its price of $385 ($3211 in 2016 dollars). Throughout its 12-year run, the Model 7 remained essentially the same as the prototype, with only minor production updates over the years. The Model 7C simply signified that the chassis was mounted in a wooden case.'
