        text: 'Because the CX does not have a cooling fan, you should ensure the CX has adequate ventilation if running processor intensive functions, and we recommend you leave the background audio analysis function in Roon at its default settings, or turn it off. If you decide to set CPUs to run at 100% to complete background analysis you should monitor the heat of the CX case.'
