        text: 'Solid-state mono-block power amplifier with balanced (XLR) and single-ended (RCA) inputs and "Autoformer"-coupled output stage. Minimum sinewave continuous average power output: 500W into 8, 4, or 2 ohms (27dBW, 24dBW, 21dBW, respectively). Rated power bandwidth: 20Hz-20kHz. THD: 0.005% into 8, 4, or 2 ohms, 250mW to rated power output. IMD: 0.005% maximum if instantaneous peak output does not exceed twice the rated output for any combination of frequencies, 20Hz-20kHz, into 8, 4, or 2 ohms. Dynamic headroom: 1.8dB. Wideband damping factor: 100 at 8 ohms (equivalent to a source impedance of 0.08 ohms) Frequency responses: 20Hz-20kHz, +0/-0.25dB; 10Hz-100kHz, +0/-3dB. Sensitivity: 2.1V unbalanced input, 4.2V balanced input. Signal/noise ratio: 97dB, A-weighted (124dB below rated output), unbalanced and balanced. Input impedance: 10k ohms unbalanced, 20k ohms balanced.'
