        text: '"Among solid-state units, the Grail is distinguished by its sheer dynamic wallop and superbly low noise floor. It will help to goose just about any set of loudspeakers with its unabashed sonic horsepower. The bottom line is that the Grail brought its own set of attributes to the music—dynamic effervescence coupled with a smooth sound. Kudos to A.J. Van den Hul for not resting on his abundant laurels and striving to produce a top-drawer phono stage that exceeds his previous efforts."'
