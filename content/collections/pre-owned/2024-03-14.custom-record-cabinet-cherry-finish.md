        text: 'Custom built record cabinet, cherry finish. The cabinet will hold 480 albums between the top bins and drawers. Heavy-duty sliders on the drawers to support the weight with soft close mechanism. Cabinet has one split on the face finish - only noticible from close examination. Cabinet sold as new for $3,300.00 and is a very well made piece of furniture. '
