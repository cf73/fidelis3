The table comes with all original box, packing and accessories and sold as new for $10,295.00. This model was used as a sample at a trade show and is otherwise unused. Full floating suspension and outboard motor/speed controller make this table an outstanding performer and the TA-1000 Neo is a good match for any medium compliance cartridge. '

        text: 'Volvere delivers a substantial sound, its forte being bass, which it delivers with a weight and power that is rare among turntables in this class. There is more than just bass, because of the very low noise floor, real instruments float in the soundscape and there is excellent front to back depth as well as left to right width, sucking you into a soundstage that will bring you into the performance.'
