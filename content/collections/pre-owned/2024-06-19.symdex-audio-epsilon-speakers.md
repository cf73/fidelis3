        text: "One of the great little-known floor-standers. These were the last speakers made by Kevin Voecks’ original company that operated up through the late 90's. The 3-way Epsilon Signature was the new owner’s (Leland Wallace) update of Voecks’ design. The Signature version was their final statement speaker, made around 1995 and cost $5000 at the time. This pair was put together on order for Jeremy Kipnis' Epiphany Recordings, an audiophile record company based in Redding, CT. They were set up so that each driver could be connected separately for bi-amped or even tri-amped operation if desired. They can also be driven by single inputs by just jumping the copper terminals."

        text: 'These are three-way units weighing 85 pounds each. Measurements: 48 ½" tall, by 13" wide and 13" deep. They are extremely efficient and rated at nominal 4 ohms so do not need a high power amp, but it should be a good one due to the revealing nature of these speakers. Their dynamic range is remarkable.'

        text: 'The crossover is incredibly accurate and first order throughout, with huge hand-selected capacitors and very hefty chokes. Speaker terminals are large copper threaded screws. Wallace is an opponent of overdamped speakers that he claimed are often thus because of uncontrolled resonances, so in addition to the limited acousta-stuf damping, he coated all interiors with a proprietary material to reduce internal reflective waves.'
