        text: 'Pioneer SX-1250 Receiver. Unit is in good physical and functional condition with some scratches and scuff on the wooden casework and metal fins, which is typical for the age. Some of the controls are a bit noisy and could use a cleaning by a technician. This is a classic model and sought after on the used market. Typical selling range on this model is $2,000.00-$3,000.00 and significantly more for units that have been fully refurbished. '
