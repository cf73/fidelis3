        text: "The 'Basis II' provides a silky smooth, clean, dynamic presentation with low distortion using a Class 'A' zero feedback circuit providing a low output impedance and high input impedance. If you have never heard the virtues of a 6SN7 based preamp, especially one designed by Purity Audio Design, you do not know what you are missing. Don't let the affordable cost of the Basis MKII fool you, this is a piece that is very much at home in the most elaborate audiophile systems and decors. The sound of the Basis MKII is has a better sense of refinement and dynamic impact at the frequency extremes. Like all Purity Audio Design products, the Basis MKII provides a dead quiet background allowing you to enjoy and appreciate the finest nuances hidden within your recordings along with a broad soundstage positioning you in the center of the performance. The Basis II features 4 line level inputs. Two sets of RCA outputs are perfect for bi-amping or driving a powered subwoofer.\_"
