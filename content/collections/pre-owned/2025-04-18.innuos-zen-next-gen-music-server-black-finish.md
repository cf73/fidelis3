        text: 'The digital source has become a known sight on Hi-Fi systems for its convenience. Almost all the music can now be accessible at the touch of a button. But playing sound is one thing and playing music is another. To get the true essence of the recording, your digital signal must be as pristine and well-timed as possible so your DAC can play at its best. Feed it with a noisy signal and that will just be amplified along the chain.'

        text: "A new modular approach for storage and audio connectivity options creates a hugely versatile device; use just as a streamer with no on-board storage at all or as a music server with Sense or Roon Core with up to 16TB of seamless storage, whilst maximizing sonic output through your choice of optimal Digital Output Module â€“ all housed in a new premium 10mm CNC-machined aluminium chassis. And if that's not enough, we have designed the ZEN Next-Gen to be upgradeable to a ZENith Next-Gen at any time."
