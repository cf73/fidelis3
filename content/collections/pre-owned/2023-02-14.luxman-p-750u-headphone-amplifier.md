        text: 'The P-750u is a meticulously refined evolution of LUXMAN''s P-700u, itself a highly respected, industry standard, high-end headphone amplifier, revered by many headphone listeners. Central to the design of this headphone amplifier is LECUA (LUXMAN Electronically Controlled Ultimate Attenuator), a high fidelity computer controlled attenuator which we feel is the ideal volume adjustment system. The P-750u also features ODNF Version 4.0 (Only Distortion Negative Feedback), a proprietary LUXMAN feedback circuit integral to this perfectly balanced headphone amplifier. The addition of a 4-pin XLR balanced headphone output to the P-750u completes the evolution by extending the choice of compatible headphones and elevating the listening experience for even the most ardent headphone users to uncharted heights.'
