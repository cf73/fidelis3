        text: 'Venmill Industries VMI 3500a CD cleaning/buffing system. Unit belonged to a client that passed away and seems to be in good working and physical condition. The slip shows that the unit was purchased in 2023 as a "refurbished" model. Currently a refurbished unit sells for $1,200.00 on the manufacturers web site. Original box, but no internal packing - we will pack for secure shipping however. Owner''s manual, power cord and a new set of buffing discs included. Not entirely what the unit sold new for, but we estimate around $2,000.00'
