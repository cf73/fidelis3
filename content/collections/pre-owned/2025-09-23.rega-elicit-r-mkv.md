        text: "The all new Elicit MK5 stereo integrated amplifier is designed and built to the highest standard. Housed in our latest custom case to match the rest of the Rega range, the new MK5 builds on previous Rega designs by using our multi-award-winning Class A/B power amplifier circuit to deliver a powerful 105 W per channel into 8\_Ω loads (127 W into 6 Ω). Our engineers have designed a new Rega DAC circuit offering digital connectivity and greater integration with a variety of other products.\_We have taken great care to incorporate a high-quality MM phono stage and the headphone output has been configured such that the speaker switching is performed by the output mute relay to avoid obstructing the signal path."

As you would expect, special attention has been paid to the selection of key audio components. Discrete circuitry, high-quality relays, polypropylene capacitors, and Sanken output transistors are used throughout the design.\_"

        text: "The galvanically/optically isolated digital inputs utilise a Wolfson S/PDIF receiver IC to provide exceptional detail and clarity from any connected source. Output is provided by a Wolfson DAC and Rega designed discrete line-driver circuit.\_The new Elicit MK5 calls upon decades of award-winning experience in amplifier and digital circuit design which culminates in a perfectly engineered balance of reliability, connectivity and above all, accurate music reproduction."
