        text: 'Rotel RSX-1067 Surround Receiver, 7-channel x 100 watts. Outdated for surround sound due to lack of HDMI switching, but still a very fine receiver for stereo reproduction. Sold as new for $2,200.00. Unit is in good physical and functional condition, but has an after-market remote rather than original. '
