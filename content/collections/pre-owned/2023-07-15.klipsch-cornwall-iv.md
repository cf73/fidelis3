        text: 'Form follows function: The newly redesigned Klipsch Cornwall IV tower loudspeaker gets its name from its versatile ability to operate either in a corner or against a wall. No wonder this user-friendly, forward-looking design has stood the test of time. Boasting a history stretching back to 1959, the award-winning Cornwall IV debuted as the second center-channel speaker commercially made – originally devised to serve as a complement to a pair of Klipschorns. Ever since, it''s become a Klipsch classic and part of a Heritage Series that constitutes a crucial part of American high-end audio. With a made-to-order enclosure constructed by hand in the U.S.A. and horn-loaded compression drivers, Cornwall IV sounds as enticing as it looks. It''s also one of the few – if only – loudspeakers with such a following that it triggered a letter-writing campaign and passionate petition after it was briefly discontinued in 1990.'

        text: 'Cornwall IV understands bass needs to be full-range, copious, powerful, controlled, and taut. To such aims, the three-way model arrives equipped with a massive, fiber-cone 15-inch K-33 woofer and front-firing ports to provide low-end responsiveness that helps make music sound more vibrant, rich, clear, complete, and real. Yes, you''re gonna feel it. And you''ll undoubtedly hear how the elevated degrees of tonal smoothness, front-to-back sound staging, grit-free cleanness, and expansive dynamics delivered by Cornwall IV impact your music. The 1.75-inch K-702 polyamide compression midrange driver coupled with a Tractix horn and one-inch K-107 titanium tweeter also deserve a heaping of thanks. Ditto an upgraded audiophile-grade crossover that uses the voicing from Klipschorn K6 and La Scala. Sensitivity (102dB) and output levels that come close to those of Klipsch''s fully horn-loaded models add to its flexibility and capability to be paired with a variety of amplifiers – especially tube types. Friends, Cornwall IV can play loud. Prepare to rock out while enjoying an extremely generous sweet spot.'
