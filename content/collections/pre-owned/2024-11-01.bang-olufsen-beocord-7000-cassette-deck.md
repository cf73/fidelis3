        text: "Bang & Olufsen Beocord 7000 tape deck, white finish. I have two of these that are brand new in the box and unused. We opened one to photograph, but the other is still sealed. The tape deck sold as new for $1,250.00 and is a super-premium device, both sonically and mechanically. Usage in a non-B&O system will require a DIN>RCA adaptor, which is readily available on eBay.\_"
