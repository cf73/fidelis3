        text: 'A while back, we were privileged to be introduced to a new super high-end diamond tweeter SEAS developed called the White Diamond. We were extremely impressed and immediately requested that SEAS build us up a matching cost-no-object woofer based on specific parameters to meet our performance goals.'

        text: 'The performance of the Sierra Diamond is astonishing, but customers as well as those who auditioned this speaker noted that as impressed as they were with the diamond tweeter, the woofer was equally impressive. We fully agreed. The midbass punch, bass extension, midrange detail, frequency response linearity, and overall dynamics was the best we had ever come across in a woofer this size, and even compared to many larger woofers.'

Problem was, being a true custom build - each of these woofers was being hand made for us by SEAS’s engineering team. These had never been mass produced.'
