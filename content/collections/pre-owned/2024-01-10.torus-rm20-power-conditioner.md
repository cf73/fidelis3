        text: 'The RM 20 uses a single 2400 VA toroidal transformer to supply 120V at 20A to the 10 AC outlets on its rear panel. It has a 20 a circuit breaker for its on off switch and uses a 14 AWG detachable AC cord rated at 15 amp/125V. “The PIU greatly enhances subtle details of tone, timber, and imaging when dynamics were extreme or the volume was loud”, and is a recommended component of Stereophile magazine.'
