And that's just skimming the particulars of a Japanese-built reference instrument that gets you dangerously near the level of performance mustered by its six-times-more-expensive sibling separates. Entirely dual-mono throughout, the 240Wpc F-05 features a proprietary Quad Volume Control System responsible for see-through clarity, wondrous channel separation, and spot-on-accurate phase traits. Tailored to deliver music's unforgettable expressiveness and soul-baring emotion with uncommon rapture, F-05 also includes gargantuan power supplies in the form of large-core 940VA custom El power transformers and 40,000µF block capacitors for each channel. A dual-mono MM/MC phono preamplifier, abundantly dynamic headphone amplifier, three-band tone control, and ball-bearing control knobs help complete a component second-to-none in its class when it comes to fit, finish, and pride of ownership.\_"

        text: 'The design feature of F-05 that most clearly reflects its Grandioso peer relates to its dual-monaural configuration, which maintains complete left and right channel independence through all stages, from preamplifier to the power amplifier''s final stage. The major investments made in circuit construction expertise and materials developed over the years yield excellent channel separation and a measure of sound quality that transcends the class.'

        text: 'Esoteric''s proprietary Quad Volume Control System (QVCS) incorporates four precision-switched resistor ladder networks operating in unison to electronically and independently control the left and right channels and their positive and negative phases. This system helps maintain superb audio clarity, excellent channel separation, and highly accurate phase characteristics. And by eliminating all volume control wiring on the audio board, the shorter signal path minimizes deterioration of sound quality while realizing exceptionally low distortion. Furthermore, as a countermeasure against noise, all control lines are electronically separated from the main body of the preamplifier with the use of isolator elements integrated into the front panel.'

This system enables users to adjust tone settings free of any concerns about sound-quality deterioration. Shifting the variable band more than usual toward the high- and low-frequency ranges (14kHz/63Hz) permits fine adjustment of bass and treble without adversely affecting the original signal. Fully electronic control also permits fine adjustment of up to ±12dB in 0.5dB steps. The middle band can also be utilized as a loudness preset when set to the minus side and used in conjunction with the Tone Bypass switch.'
