        text: 'Compared to the award-winning Statement 450, the new Statement 452 has greater headroom for unfettered musical impact, and a greater sense of body, space, and organic cohesiveness. You will hear more deeply into the recording space, catch delicate nuances in a singer’s phrasing you’ve not heard before; cymbals explode with more detail and energy, bass lines drive the music with more presence and playfulness... in short, the Statement 452 presents an absolute breakthrough in fidelity to the music.'

        text: 'The unconventional vertical architecture and lateral tube mounting play a large part in achieving this new sonic freedom. All relevant signal, power, and ground pathways in this hardwired amplifier are as short as possible, resulting in greatly increased resolution and dynamics. Truly, this is a ‘form follows function’ design.'

        text: 'The circuitry exploits VAC’s high speed parallel processing principle, with smaller parts that are willing to ‘jump’ electrically and magnetically with the music, where other amplifiers use large, musically ponderous components. There are a total of nine VAC design transformers in the Statement 452, in aggregate weighing 120 pounds, for perfect coupling combined with lightning fast speed.'

        text: "The Statement 452 circuitry is fully balanced.\_ Provision is made for accepting single-ended inputs, converting them to balanced prior to amplification. With VAC’s Musicbloc™ design, switch settings allow the amplifier to be configured for 450 watt single-channel mono operation, or as a\_ 225 watt/channel dual mono amplifier, all without any compromise in either mode. This means you can start a system with a single Statement 452, and add another later for more power; if you have a pair of Statement 452, you can run them as mono-blocks, or in dual mono for bi-amplification. These amplifiers can grow with you and conform to changing system demands."
