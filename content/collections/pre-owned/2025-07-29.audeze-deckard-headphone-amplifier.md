        text: "If music is an important part of your life you deserve to hear the real thing. The Deckard is a powerhouse of a headphone amplifier combined with a high-performance DAC. Thereâ€™s a front panel volume control and switches to choose gain and input so you can use the Deckard as a great line-level preamp to drive your whole desktop system. The sound is exciting and dynamic with beautifully rendered tonal colors that make music come alive.\_The DAC section has impressive specs and handles 16 to 32-bits and 44.1kHz to 384kHz sampling rates. The Deckard features a single-ended class-A output stage with good damping characteristics to control the strong and tuneful bass. Its power handling capabilities at lower impedances is ideal for planar magnetic headphones, but It drives any headphone with power to spare."
