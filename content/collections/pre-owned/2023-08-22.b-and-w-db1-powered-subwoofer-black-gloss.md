        text: 'B&W DB1 Powered Subwoofer, Gloss Black. Unit is in excellent physical and functional condition with original box, packing and accessories. Unit sold as new for $4,500.00. There are a few minor scuffs on the top - you can''t see them from most angles and only in certain light, but they are there. My guess is that they could be buffed out with a scratch remover, but this is always an issue with soft, gloss finishes. Likely something was set on top at one point and slid off. The sub is immaculate other than that.'
