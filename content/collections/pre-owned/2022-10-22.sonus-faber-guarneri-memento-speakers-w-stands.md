        text: '"While Sonus Faber''s Guarneri memento won''t play extremely loud, it played loud enough. While it doesn''t go way down low, it went deep enough: just below 40Hz with conviction. And while it can''t produce the dynamic slam of a bigger speaker, it provided a convincing spectrum of dynamics, particularly at the microdynamic end of the scale, where music lives and breathes.'

        text: 'But I easily and quickly forgot what the Guarneri memento couldn''t deliver, because of the quality of what it could: transparency, delicacy, detail; a lack of mechanical artifacts such as dryness, edge, and etch; and a wide, surprisingly deep, ultra-stable soundstage. In terms of pure musical pleasure and involvement, the Sonus Faber Guarneri mementos rank near the top in my listening experience, especially in the reproduction of small acoustic ensembles. I went in a skeptic and came out a believer."'
