        text: 'Aurender''s N100 series was a best-seller for over 6 years. It has recently been replaced with model N150, but the N100 series has provided music lovers the world over with an accessible way to love their music "The Aurender Way" - with an elegant user experience, and pristine digital signal output to an integrated amplifier or DAC. Available in three distinct configurations, N100 offers true audiophile performance from a small footprint.'
