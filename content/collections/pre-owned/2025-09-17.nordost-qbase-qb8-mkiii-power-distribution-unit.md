        text: 'An excellent way to treat AC power and yield cleaner, clearer, more natural sound, the eight-outlet QBASE QB8 Mark III AC distribution unit/power conditioner impacts every component connected to it — and improves each one in unique ways. It registers all-encompassing effects on your system in manners that involve enhancing the 3D imaging on the soundstage; pulling out tonal richness and sustained decay time in music; and imparting a noticeable increase of power while maintaining neutral, effortless delivery.'

        text: 'QBASE QB8 Mark III AC addresses the noise-inducing, conflicting flows of signal and ground paths within your system by using a unique method called "star-earth topology.” This approach connects all the outlets from one central point (or outlet) to the input. QBASE QB8 Mark III AC does this while additionally lifting the impedance level on every outlet save for the one deemed "Primary Earth.” Elevating the ground in such a passive manner achieves three remarkable results: it creates an uninterrupted, straight-line AC distribution path from the wall to each individual component; isolates each component by deterring the ground flow between them; and eliminates conflicting flow between signal and ground paths, all without any form of in-line filtering or active circuitry.'

        text: "Made of a mechanically tuned, extruded aluminum body, and outfitted with\_ durable connectors that maintain excellent connectivity even after extensive use, QBASE QB8\_Mark III AC also features a dual-level PC-board configuration that separates all ground connections from the line and neutral traces. Consequently, it minimizes any interference or crosstalk between live/neutral and ground currents. Each QBASE QB8 Mark III is also internally wired with Nordost Mono-Filament wire and equipped with a resistance \"sink\" that adds protection and effectively damps eddy currents."
