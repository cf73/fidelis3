        text: 'Vivid B1 Speakers, Gloss Black finish. Speakers are in excellent overall condition (couple of scuffs on one base and one very small nick on one speaker) and come with original crates, grills, spikes and jumpers. Speakers sold as new for $15,000.00 originally and went up to $18,000.00 prior to being discontinued in favor of the B1D, which sold for $28,000.00. Superb imaging speakers that have incredible detail and micro-dynamics.'
