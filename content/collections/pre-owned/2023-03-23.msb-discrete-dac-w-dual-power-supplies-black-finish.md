        text: 'With two prime DACs, we yield an unprecedented level of detail, reproducing the musicality, soundstage, and texture of an original performance, bringing the artist to you. A fully balanced, ultra-high precision, discrete ladder DAC architecture ensures each note tells a story. Additionally, MSB’s robust in-house design enables the finest quality playback of PCM and native DSD, while our low impedance circuitry drives your amplification directly without adding coloration or buffering noise. The end result is a digital experience defying expectations.'

        text: 'Superior conversion begins with clean and stable low-noise power. The Discrete Power Supply feeds the DAC with dual low-noise power streams that are linear and independent. That’s not all—the CNC unibody aluminum chassis provides the discrete power supply with optimal thermal performance and an elegant design aesthetic. The DAC comes equipped with a single power supply, but can be augmented with a second discrete power supply to enable optimized power isolation between all major components.'
