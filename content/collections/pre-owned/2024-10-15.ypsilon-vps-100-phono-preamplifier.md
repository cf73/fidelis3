        text: 'Ypsilon VPS 100 Phono Preamplifier in excellent condition with original flight case. Designed specifically for either MM or high-output MC cartridges, the YPS 100 can be used with an outboard step-up transformer for low-output MC cartridges. Unit sells as new for $26,000.00. Unit is in excellent physical and functional condition. '

        text: 'The VPS 100 is a moving magnet valve phono stage which uses passive RIAA equalization incorporating inductors, capacitors and resistors (LCR) in conjunction with two stages of gain. The RIAA network is driven by a custom transformer which is wound in-house. The LCR networks are most commonly used and based on double T filter networks. One T filter forms the 50-500 Hz poles and the second T filter forms the 2123 Hz pole. In the VPS-100, the 2123 Hz pole is formed by an air core inductor with practically no stray capacitance at the first gain stage, and the 50-500 Hz poles are formed in high signal level directly at the output of the second gain stage. So, this is a split RIAA design using two gain stages based on the SIEMENS C3g tube which is very reliable supposedly and specified for 10,000 hours of use.'

        text: 'The power supply uses a 6CA4 tube rectifier and a choke filter. The heaters for the tubes are AC in the second stage and DC passive-regulated for the first stage. The construction uses no printed circuit boards and is point-to-point silver wired using Ypsilon’s proprietary extruded and annealed to-spec silver wire. Special attention is paid to mechanically decouple the first gain stage and 2123 pole coils using a specially designed decoupling system.'

        text: "Passive RIAA equalization is preferred to active because in active RIAA equalization there is a feedback loop and the RIAA network is in this feedback loop.\_Usually RIAA equalizer circuits are implemented with capacitors and resistors (CR networks). Capacitors present the so called “dielectric absorption” -energy is stored in the dielectric material and is added to the signal with a small delay producing a ringing character in fundamental notes. This ringing behavior can be noticed in piano notes.\_In the past an alternative way of implementing a RIAA equalizer the LCR (Inductance-capacitance-resistance) circuit was proposed."

        text: "\_A long time ago TANGO transformers from Japan used to produce such a circuit working in 600Ohms.\_A few manufacturers are using LCR based phono stages using variations of the original TANGO LCR circuit. The challenge in 600ohm LCR eq is to drive the network properly; having no more than 2 gain stages with enough overall gain and low enough output impedance."

        text: 'The best way of driving the LCR network is by using a transformer. We design and build ourselves the transformers using a special amorphous c-core material. Winding insulation is paper. A properly implemented LCR RIAA sounds much more natural, musical and open than CR networks with better defined macro and micro dynamics.'

        text: 'In the VPS-100 we took it one step further, the 2123Hz pole is formed by air core inductor with practically no stray capacitance at the first gain stage and the 50-500Hz poles are formed in high signal level directly at the output of the second gain stage. So this is a split RIAA design using two gain stages based on the SIEMENS C3g tube. These tubes are very reliable as they are specified for 10.000 hours.'
