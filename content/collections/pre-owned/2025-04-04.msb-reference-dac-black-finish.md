        text: 'MSB Reference DAC w/PowerBase in Black Finish. The unit is in excellent physical and functional condition with original boxes, packing and accessories. Units sold as new for $54,500.00. Stock input card installed - AES/EBU, S/PDIF and TosLink inputs. There is one barely noticeable scuff on the top of the PowerBase and a couple of extremely small nicks in the finish around one the foot receptacles, which no one will ever see when the units are stacked. This is a world class DAC that can be used as an analog preamp for one source and has a true analog volume control for direct input into an amplifier. '
