        text: 'AiOS can stream or playback native PCM files up to 32-bit 384 kHz (.WAV files up to 768 kHz), plus DSD 64, 128, 256, and 512. Connect AiOS to your home network (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) and stream all of your digital music stored on your networked computer(s) or NAS drive(s) with simple plug N play UPnP, DLNA, and SMB connectivity. Also available through your home network connection are integrated internet music streaming services such as Spotify Connect, TIDAL Connect, Qobuz, and vTuner. For those who may find a home network connection too intimidating, AiOS allows you to insert an SD Card into the front SD Slot. You can also use a USB flash drive or USB hard drive loaded with digital music files directly to AiOS’ three USB-A inputs, all without a computer or network connection for direct playback. How about Bluetooth? Today, Bluetooth is ubiquitous, and AiOS can connect to your smartphone or tablet using the latest Qualcomm aptX© Bluetooth technology. However, AiOS has an extra trick up its sleeve. It can send any of its selected sources to Bluetooth-enabled headphones or speakers for a complete wireless music system, so you don’t have to fuss over unsightly wires. Place AiOS anywhere to add beauty and elegance to any room or décor.'

        text: 'Speaking of beauty and elegance, AiOS is visually transformative. With the touch of a button, AiOS can change its backlit keys/buttons and center LCD display (together or individually) to six different preset colors, including one custom color preset, or adjust any color as you see fit within the entire color spectrum. As if the all-aluminum gunmetal gray chassis and side panels (standard) aren’t handsome enough, AiOS offers five additional side panel color options. This ensures that AiOS can create the perfect blend of sight and sound to match both your lifestyle and décor choices within any setting.'
