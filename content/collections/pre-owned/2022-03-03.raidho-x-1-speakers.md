        text: "Raidho Acoustics’ newest speaker, the X1, is an elegant and compact stand-mount mini monitor. The speaker is built with the Raidho Ribbon Tweeter and a bass/mid-range driver with a ceramic membrane. The mid-range driver features our newly developed neodymium based magnet system, long throw and low compression.\_ The loudspeaker is primarily designed for smaller rooms and can be placed relatively close to the rear wall. The X1 is also ideal for studio work and near-field monitoring."
