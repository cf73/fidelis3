        text: 'The 47 Laboratory Model 4713 Flatfish CD player/transport, Model 4705 Progression DAC and 4799 Power Dumpty power supply are a revelation. Power up these honeys and you will search for a way to beg, borrow or steal to own them. As a trio, they make music that is utterly relaxed and non-fatiguing, but full of information -- fast transients, titanic bass, lush midrange -- and nearly perfect tonality. The 47 Lab re-creates the unique personality of each CD, like some wacky sound therapist enabling each CD to find its way to full expression just for you in the privacy of your listening room. Itâ€™s you and the musicians -- no stereo, no noisy crowd, no end in sight."'
