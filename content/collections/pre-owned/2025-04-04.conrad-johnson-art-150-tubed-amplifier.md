        text: 'The audio circuit of these amplifiers has just three elements, each as simple as possible, and each essential to the operation of the amplifier. A voltage gain amplifier (a single triode) is direct-coupled to a cathode coupled phase inverter (each phase handled by a single triode), which in turn drives the output stage. Power is developed by KT150 output tubes, chosen for their musical accuracy, high power, and reliability. A single pair is used for each channel to comfortably and reliably achieve the 150 Watts per channel power rating of the ART150, while two pairs are used to produce 300 Watts in the mono ART300. A small amount (about 12 dB) of loop negative feedback reduces distortion and achieves a sufficiently high damping factor to control reactive loudspeaker systems. To assure continued peak performance, the owner need only make a simple bias adjustment when new tubes are installed. Built in LED bias indicators allow the user to make this adjustment using only the supplied adjustment tool.'
