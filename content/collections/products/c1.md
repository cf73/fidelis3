        text: 'Michael Børresen and his team of experts were able to leverage the cutting-edge technology and development process of the Børresen C series membrane. The membrane consists of three laminated layers: two layers of spread-tow carbon fiber with a honeycomb spacer in between. This design provides optimal stiffness, reducing sound-disturbing vibrations and resonances, which leads to exceptional clarity in the bass and midrange frequencies.'

        text: 'The C1 is equipped with Børresen’s renowned RP94 ribbon tweeter, a signature feature of the Børresen brand. With a remarkable efficiency of 94 dB and an ultra-light moving mass of just 0.01 grams, this closed ribbon tweeter is capable of incredible speed and responsiveness. Operating from 2.5 kHz and above, it captures the finest sonic details with precision and is robust enough to handle high transient peaks without distortion. This level of detail and clarity allows listeners to experience music with a level of subtlety and refinement rarely achieved.'

        text: 'The Børresen C series speaker enclosures are constructed from internally reinforced wood composite material, designed to minimize sound distortion, standing waves, and external resonances. This material, combined with 1mm-thick carbon fiber panels applied to the sides, significantly increases the rigidity of the enclosure. Glossy white/black side stripes laid on top of the thick carbon layers allow this material to work at its very best, and greatly contribute to the speaker’s unique aesthetic.'

        text: 'The C1 loudspeaker stands are designed to support the Børresen C1 speakers in the best possible way by placing the speakers in the correct height and angle. The stands are made of the same robust wood composite material as the cabinets, creating the perfect synergy between speakers and stands. As the stands are without iron components any magnetically interference into the loudspeakers crossovers is avoided. The stands are equipped with Ansuz Darkz S2t Resonance Control devices, further reducing vibrations and improving sound quality. The stands can also be upgraded with additional Darkz for even greater resonance control and performance enhancement. The Børresen C1 loudspeaker represents the pinnacle of stand-mounted speaker design, combining advanced technology and meticulous craftsmanship to deliver a truly extraordinary musical experience.'
