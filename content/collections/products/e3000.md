        text: 'employs the ANCC principle. The power amplifier section produces balanced signals relying on the instrumentation amplifier principle while simultaneously creating a robust output stage through three-fold parallel push-pull power transistors driven in class AB. Every moment spent immersed in the vibrant playback of the E-3000 is one to relish.'
