        text: 'The first Esoteric K-05 model was introduced in 2011, evolved into the K-05X in 2015, and K-05Xs in 2018. It has become the best-selling model at the heart of the ESOTERIC K Series. The Esoteric K-05XD SACD Player inherits the philosophy of the historic K-05 series but is totally redesigned as a Super Audio CD player; completely different from the previous 05 models by way of revamping it with an all-new design platform.'

        text: 'Incorporating the fruits of our labor resulting from the development of the Grandioso G1X master clock generator, a unique discrete clock circuit for built-in players, the “Master Sound Discrete Clock for Digital Player” is employed. An enlarged double-layer chassis accommodates the upgraded ATLAS mechanism, each larger circuit block, and the power supply section, while it’s the elegant appearance of the K-05XD, – which is even closer now to the upper models, – subtly asserts the richness of its content, worthy of being called a major innovation.'
