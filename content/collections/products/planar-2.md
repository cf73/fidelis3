              Historically, Rega has proved
              highly adept at making affordable
              high performance vinyl spinners,
              and the latest Planar 2 shows
              why. It feels much less built-down to-a-price than its rivals, and is
              more solid, better finished and
              smarter looking too. Then there’s
              the sound, which is far more
              musically enjoyable than you have
              any right to expect for just £375.
              Its painless, straight out of the
              box set-up is a real bonus too!
