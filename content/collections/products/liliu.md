            text: 'Can 50 years really have passed since I brought home the LP version of this unequivocal masterpiece? The Lilium brought back that day in December 1969 when I queued to buy it. Pitter-patter stage right and the raunchy organ break in ‘I’m Looking Through You’, Ringo’s astounding drumming on ‘You Won’t See Me’ – this was always my favourite Beatles album. The Lilium made me fall in love all over again.'
