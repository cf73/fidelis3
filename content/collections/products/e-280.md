        text: 'The AAVA volume control builds upon the knowledge of high-end equipment to control volume without loss of information. The power amplification section utilizes the instrumentation amplifier principle to create an ideal speaker driver. The low impedance design of the output circuitry brings out the full potential of every speaker. Two option boards can be added for improved expandability. The E-280 sound performance will defy the imagination.'
