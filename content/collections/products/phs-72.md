        text: "Behind every JMF Audio product development lies music lovers' motivation. While most historical recordings have been remastered and transferred to modern formats, we felt that the digital versions failed to carry the emotion and ambiances in their integrality. That the recordings from the golden era had to be enjoyed in the format they were intended for."

        text: 'JMF Audio’s knowhow in analog had been recognized in world-class recording studios as well as by audio connoisseurs for more than 30 years. The definitive phono pre-amplifier’s circuits would be developed capitalizing on our experience and our latest innovations. As the PHS phono pre-amplifier would inherit from several of the PRS 1.5 line-level pre-amplifier’s aspects, the project could have been expected to be completed in less time than usual for JMF Audio. The research and development and the manufacturing of specific components eventually required some additional years of dedication… and lead to two models.'

        text: 'Both these sensors are made of a coil that needs to be connected to a signal amplifier. The signals are of very low magnitude and need to be protected against electromagnetic interference before amplification. This is why microphones have always been connected through shielded balanced interconnections in the recording studio world. For cost reasons related to consumer applications and also because the original cartridges were of moving magnet type, phono interconnections have been widely made through un-balanced links with RCA connectors.'

        text: 'Quite a few modern cartridges feature rigid cantilevers and tend to present an un-even response with a significant rise of magnitude at the upper frequencies. Low value resistive loading is commonly admitted as the only way to obtain an acceptable response from these cartridges. The JMF Audio PHS phono pre-amplifiers propose an alternative through combined resistive and capacitive loading for precise dampening and tuning of the upper range of frequencies and achieve a linear overall response. By releasing the constraints on the cartridge, the musical rendering shows greater openness and liveliness. The load value being dependent on the cartridge, the setting is located near the corresponding input, which ensures the shortest signal path. All inputs load settings are easily controllable at sight from the rear panel.'
