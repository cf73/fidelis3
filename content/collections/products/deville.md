    type: Review
    excerpt: '<p>The DeVille has impacted the landscape of two-way stand-mount designs in a significant way, so much so, that it has become my favorite speaker in this genre. It’s agnostic when it comes to power amps and is comfortable with almost anything north of 8Wpc. It offers a winning combination of excellent engineering and exceptional execution, and is capable of weaving a considerable amount of sonic magic, of recreating a moment in space and time that is utterly convincing. Very few speakers are capable of accomplishing that, especially at this asking price. The De- Ville will surely win many friends for the Fleetwood Sound Company. A must-audition for audiophiles, young and old alike.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>'
