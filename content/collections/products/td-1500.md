        text: 'In 1965, the Thorens TD 150, an inconspicuous little turntable, came on the market and thus started a technical revolution in record player manufacturing. For the first time, a spring-suspended sub-chassis with an inner platter driven by a flat belt was used in a mass-produced unit. The principle proved to be very successful and found many imitators in the years since.'

        text: 'Like its famous predecessor, the new Thorens TD 1500, which will be operated purely manually, features a sub-chassis that decouples the turntable and tonearm shelf from the motor and frame by means of three conical springs. In contrast to the TD 150, these springs can be adjusted from above through corresponding holes in the platter, which makes correct adjustment much easier.'

        text: 'The speed of the DC motor is electronically monitored by an incremental encoder and deviations, e.g. caused by a broom, are automatically corrected. This also enables very good wow and flutter values.'
