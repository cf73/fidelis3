            text: "And how does it sound? In a word – Glorious! To describe the sound in terms of bass, mid-range and treble would be sacrilege. It would be similar to describing a Salvador Dali painting in terms of structure. It’s not perfunctorily structured; it flows, bends reality and lures your eyes across the face of the image.\_\_"
