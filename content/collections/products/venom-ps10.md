        text: 'Every part and material within the PS10 has been optimized for maximum peak-current transfer, as evidenced by its massive peak and continuous current ratings. With a powerful 20A capability for the unit, the PS10 will support entire systems, massive high-current amplifiers, and everything in between. Venom PS10 outlets grip power cords tightly, making it nearly impossible to dislodge the power cords unless removed by hand. In short, the PS10 highlights the critical relationship between clean, uninterrupted power, and getting the best performance possible from your home-entertainment system.'

This 6′ integrated Venom NR power cord reduces RF and impulse noise across all frequencies, leading to improved detail and imaging, smoother highs, and more well-defined lows. All visual images in Home Theater systems using the Venom PS10 will also be dramatically improved. Viewers of fine film will notice better depth perception, sharper color contrast, and clearer images across the screen and from front to back.'

The design and build of the PS10 demonstrates in clear terms why Shunyata Research has dominated the power-line category for the past 20 years. Clean power is foundational to the performance of medical, recording, and consumer electronics systems of all types. Venom PS10 represents the embodiment that knowledge.'
