        text: 'The line stage circuit is the same transformer- coupled Class A1 balanced triode design found in the Statement Line Stage. The external power supply has dual-mono rectification and filtering of the crucial high voltage supplies for superb, spacious imaging and great preservation of nuance. The remote volume control is of the direct-acting analogue type and continuously variable, so you easily can the precise level that makes the music snap into focus.'

        text: 'Vinyl lovers may specify the optional MM MC phono stage, which features three twin triodes operating in pure Class A1, variable MC impedance loading, and purely passive, precise RIAA equalization. The circuit topology is derived from the Signature MkII SE, differing principally in the number of tubes employed, and uses the same premium MC input transformers. The results rival and exceed those delivered by many more costly separate phono stages. You should expect nothing less of a VAC.'
