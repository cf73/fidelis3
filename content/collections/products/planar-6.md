        text: "The Planar 6 is built around the huge success of the RP8 and\_RP10\_turntables. It is the first new\_Rega\_turntable to be constructed with\_an ultra lightweight Tancast 8 polyurethane foam core plinth\_(a material developed\_for the aerospace industry). This material is sandwiched between a new HPL (high pressure laminate).\_HPL\_is exceptionally thin whilst\_extremely rigid and is\_presented in a stunning\_Polaris matt grey finished with high gloss polymer black edge trim."

        text: "The Neo PSU uses the\_Planar 10\_DSP (digital signal processing) generator built upon a high stability crystal. The DSP generator will divide the accurate signal from the crystal to the exact frequency required to turn the platter at the selected speed. The DSP generator will also produce\_a near perfect sinusoidal waveform to drive the motor. This, along with an efficient drive amplifier, generates a 24V AC balanced signal of less than 0.15% distortion, which is completely un-affected by any changes in the mains/line voltage and conditions. This then drives the turntables anti-vibration circuit, which is situated beneath the turntable."
