        text: "The Elicit MK5 now shares other design features taken directly from the highly acclaimed\_Aethos amplifier. You will find the same discrete FET based pre-amplifier circuit, plus an Alps volume potentiometer has been introduced to further improve sonic and technical performance. As you would expect, special attention has been paid to the selection of key audio components. Discrete circuitry, high-quality relays, polypropylene capacitors, and Sanken output transistors are used throughout the design.\_"

        text: "The galvanically/optically isolated digital inputs utilize a Wolfson S/PDIF receiver IC to provide exceptional detail and clarity from any connected source. Output is provided by a Wolfson DAC and Rega designed discrete line-driver circuit.\_The new Elicit MK5 calls upon decades of award-winning experience in amplifier and digital circuit design which culminates in a perfectly engineered balance of reliability, connectivity and above all, accurate music reproduction."
