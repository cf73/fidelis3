        text: 'The upgrade to COMPOSILEX 5 insulation in the noise-canceling Fluxfield cable design, brings out the amazing benefits of the world’s purest OCC-7N copper conductors. With those premium quality materials, Wireworld Electra 10 power conditioning cords deliver dramatic improvements in clarity, image focus and dynamic punch that can transform a great system into one that is truly exceptional. Electra 10’s silky smoothness and silent background make it a standout among high-end audiophile power cords. The flexible flat design bends and coils easily, so excess length is never an issue. That advantage is especially helpful because Wireworld power cords function as filters and longer lengths provide higher performance.'
