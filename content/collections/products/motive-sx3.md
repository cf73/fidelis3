        text: 'In common with Neat’s earlier stand mount models, the Motive SX3 once again raises the standard of sound quality expected from a speaker of this size and price. Ideal for use in smaller spaces or as a rear speaker in a multi-channel system, the SX3 has an open and strikingly clear sound with faithful dynamics and a focused stereo image.'

        text: 'The tweeter is the new and upgraded unit used throughout the Motive SX range and features a huge screened magnet assembly and a 25mm inverted anodised aluminium dome. This type of tweeter is usually only found in more expensive high-end loudspeakers and is therefore an exceptional inclusion to the Motive SX designs.'
