quote: 'These are great bookshelf speakers for the money; it is just that they sound like great entry-level speakers rather than blur the lines between price categories, as their class-leading rivals do.'

        text: 'Packing a punch well beyond its diminutive size the versatile F300 bookshelf speaker can be used for two channel Hi-Fi or home theatre applications. Pre-fitted to the rear panel of the F300 is a bracket allowing the speaker to be easily flush-mounted to a wall. This is a really handy feature where space is at an absolute premium, or for using the speaker as a rear effects speaker in home cinema set up.'

            text: 'The F300s offer detail and clarity that contradicts their entry-level price tag, not to mention a bass weight that belies their size. While some competitors may over-pack the low-end frequencies, leaving their presentation sonically pear-shaped, or otherwise hint at bass notes without conviction, these slender standmounters are able to deal out bottom frequencies with insight, punch and relatively little fanfare.'
