        text: 'Compact as it is in size, the ATC-5S admits of no compromise in design and components selection not to speak of manufacturing in total. Bearing a common resemblance to its predecessor A TC-1 in design concept, we poured into a tiny body all of our 30-year accumulated technologies and know-hows in terms of pre-amps’ presentation, while putting globally-selected capacitors and components into a mere 1.6mm-thick chassis featuring monocoque structure, we keep sticking to our famed, traditional manual wiring by our expert technicians, totally abandoning cost-saving printed circuit’s. On the volume control sector crucial to overall sonic quality, featured on board is the Alps gold-plated multi-contact wire-brushed controller sealed in a machined brass case. Needless to say, all the Air Tight audio gear is designed and made in Japan.'

        text: 'To ensure perfect playback of analog discs, we employed a highly rated 2-stage NF-CR circuitry for most faithful realization of RIAA curve. The NF and CR sections are made independent with thorough elimination of interference between treble and bass ranges, and unnecessary low frequency signals are crossed out to prevent unwanted vibration of speaker cones. Also provided is a useful muting function when vinyl discs are replaced in the course of playback. Abundant 3-line input allows listeners to enjoy multiple digital sources. A timer-relay system mutes output at the outset of playback, thus protecting the power amp section from transient current. The line amp section consists of orthodox 2-stage configuration featuring the 12A T7. For the sake of tight and spacious soundstage, placed are optimum decoupling circuits at all the necessary points to prevent harmful interferences.'
