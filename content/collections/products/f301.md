quote: 'Though the 300 series is at the "entry level" price point, its performance is anything but. For those looking for a sub-$500 pair of stand-mount speakers that sound like you paid four figures for, the Fyne F301 are a great choice.'

        text: "Perfect for smaller listening rooms, the F301 is a compact, stand-mount or bookshelf loudspeaker offering outstanding flexibility and class leading performance. As a front stereo pair, the F301 excels at delivering dynamic bass and the musical articulation of more expensive designs. Its high current handling is equally at home in home theatre systems where the F301's easy to drive nature and deep bass punch are compatible with a wide range of AV amplifiers and receivers.\_\_"
