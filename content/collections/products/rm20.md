        text: 'A popular model in the RM series is the RM 20, which has been consistently top-rated by leading audiophile magazines. Torus Powers power isolation units (PIUS) combine search suppression with massive toroidal transformers to provide AC power conditioning and protection from voltage surges.'

        text: 'The RM 20 uses a single 2400 VA toroidal transformer to supply 120V at 20A to the 10 AC outlets on its rear panel. It has a 20 a circuit breaker for its on off switch and uses a 14 AWG detachable AC cord rated at 15 amp/125V. “The PIU greatly enhances subtle details of tone, timber, and imaging when dynamics were extreme or the volume was loud”, and is a recommended component of Stereophile magazine.'

        text: 'Smaller models (such as RM 15) are ideal for mid-size systems, while the RM5 can be dedicated to front-end components, media servers, etc. Larger custom installation models rated 60 Amp and 100 Amp balanced input provide clean, protected power for the largest custom installed systems. Many Torus Power models feature Balanced 240V input. This configuration provides additional noise cancellation as the two input phases are 180 degrees out of phase from each other.'
