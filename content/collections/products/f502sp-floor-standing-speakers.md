quote: 'Fyne Audio’s F502SPs are a vivid listening experience. Massive bass and a fast, forward mid-band make for a sound few other loudspeakers come close to. More charismatic than smooth they offer an alternative to the commonplace. Being very revealing though, as well as demanding, they do need careful amplifier matching.'
