        text: "Filter capacity in the MA9500 has been doubled compared to the MA9000 which has produced a significant increase in dynamic headroom from 1.8dB to 2.8dB, giving the MA9500 greater ability to reproduce musical peaks with less distortion. And while the MA9000 featured great low end bass performance, the MA9500's increased filter capacity will also help deliver even more amazing bass playback and control.\_"
