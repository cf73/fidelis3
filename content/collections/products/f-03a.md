        text: 'Setting out to create one of the most desirable integrated amplifiers available, Esoteric brought together a fully balanced preamplifier and a Class-A power amplifier-both directly derived from its well-respected Grandioso line-to created a new reference for integrated amplifiers that gives full expression to the smooth, full-bodied tones and delicately shaded textures of your favorite music. Featuring distinctive dual monaural construction that extends through all stages, from preamplifier inputs through to the final stage of its power amplifier output, the F-03A Integrated Amplifier brings out the full audio potential of Esoteric''s highly regarded K and N Series of digital players.'

        text: 'Representing a new generation of integrated amplifiers, Esoteric''s new F Series has been thoroughly invested with proven results gained in the development of our flagship Grandioso line of separate amplifiers. With the goal of capturing all the inherent warmth and texture of music, not only were the outstanding expressive powers of the Grandioso line pursued, the utmost limits of audio performance were also concentrated into an integrated configuration that offers excellent usability combined with an attractiveness that more than compensates for the limitations of their size. Basic and Complete. With sights set on creating a unique presence in the category, the Esoteric F Series is born.'

            text: 'The F-03A’s rendering of space was superb, not just in width and depth but importantly in the precise placement of images within the soundstage. Notably, instruments were presented as individual objects spatially and texturally, making it easy to clearly hear individual parts within the whole. That’s one quality that many very expensive amplifiers do well; to hear it to this degree from an integrated amplifier was surprising and rewarding.'
