        text: 'Incorporating all of the preamp and power amp developments from the flagship Grandioso “X” Edition, the new F Series integrated amplifiers deliver outstanding musicality that captures the rich textures of music in a single integrated amplifier. Despite the fact that the F Series is an integrated amplifier, it delivers a thorough quality and performance that will be the envy of all separate amp users. The F Series is the integrated amplifier that owners of Esoteric’s K and N Series digital players have been waiting for, and it pushes the boundaries of integrated amplifier technology.'

            text: 'The F-03A’s rendering of space was superb, not just in width and depth but importantly in the precise placement of images within the soundstage. Notably, instruments were presented as individual objects spatially and texturally, making it easy to clearly hear individual parts within the whole. That’s one quality that many very expensive amplifiers do well; to hear it to this degree from an integrated amplifier was surprising and rewarding.'
