        text: 'The H30A is our reference power amplifier. We have nicknamed it The Orchestra because that is what it is. The H30A''s job is to take command of any music on any speakers and make it sound as good as possible without ever breaking a sweat, and we can think of no more challenging music than a large orchestral piece. The H30A is an absolute powerhouse of an amplifier. In its mono state it delivers a truly astounding 1100 watts in 8 ohms, and it is completely stable even with 1-ohm loads. To achieve this, we have applied all our skills and knowledge in amplifier design and combined that with the best electronics. The H30A power supply uses 2 separate 1000 VA toroidal transformers for fast response and minimized transformer hum. With a power bank of 270,000 μF capacitors, the H30A can handle even the most challenging piece of music at any volume, it always has enough power in reserve. In the output stage we use 56 pieces 15A 200W high speed, ultra-low distortion bipolar transistors. With so much power ready at any given time, things like speaker sensitivity and variation in loads no longer come into play. With the H30A you can confidently drive any speaker you like.'
