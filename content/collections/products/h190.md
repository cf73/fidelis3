        text: 'Crafted with precision and minimalist elegance, the H190v is housed in a solid steel chassis featuring a thick aluminium front with aluminium knobs. Available in both black and white, the amplifier is designed to complement any interior aesthetic. However, underneath its minimalist exterior, the H190v is packed with advanced features. Under the hood, H190v packs a formidable punch. With 150W class AB power in 8 Ohms, a damping factor of 4000, and a large toroidal transformer paired with high-quality output transistors, this amplifier delivers power and precision in equal measure. A dedicated and improved power supply for the preamp and DAC section creates a pitch-black background ensuring that the focus remains on the music, where every nuance is delivered with precision and control. H190v offers a taste of high-end sophistication at a sensible price point.'

It has a clarity, smoothness and dynamic quality that speaks to listeners familiar with live music and who like to actively listen. It offers impressive value as well; in fact, I’d go so far as to say this is the benchmark electronics package beyond which you have to spend substantially for small, though possibly valuable, gains.'
