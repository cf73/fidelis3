quote: 'Spec-wise, the Sonus Faber Sonetto IIs are impressive at their price point, seemingly benefiting from considerable “trickle-down” of technology from their more distinguished (and expensive) brethren. Oh, and the craftsmanship is pretty darn nice as well. Take the cabinets — they’re just gorgeous.'
