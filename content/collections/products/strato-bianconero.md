        text: 'We can also do classic and angular. Our Strato is available in two versions - with a black or white acrylic finish. The two levels enclose a solid aluminum core. In the Bianco version, the platter is made of acrylic; in the Nero version, we opted for POM. Both platters rotate above our TMD braring - but what is particularly interesting is the view underneath the platter. Instead of using an external motor - as is almost standard for us - we have combined three drives with belts, invisible but highly effective. In keeping with the classic shape, we also supply the perfectly fitting cover.'
