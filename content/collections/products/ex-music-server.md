        text: 'The small form factor Antipodes S30 is our entry-level music server and yet it is based on the advanced player engine used in the K50 and K30. The only compromise made is the external power supply brick supplied as standard. But audio performance can be dramatically enhanced by adding the HSL50-based S60 power supply. With or without the S60, the audio performance of the S30 is outstanding at the respective price points.'

        text: 'The Antipodes S30 includes an internal DAC with analog RCA outputs for convenience and ease of use. The analog sound is very detailed and musical, and it provides an elegant solution for someone who does not have a separate high-end DAC. However a high-end DAC can be plugged into the S30 USB port to enhance the outcome to an even higher level.'
