quote: 'It made my hi-fi less hi-fi and the musicians more there — with a lower level of editorializing than I''ve gotten from any previous amp-preamp combination I''ve reviewed. My new solid-state reference.'

        text: 'A smaller stereo Class A amplifier at a lower price, it takes advantage of the lower power requirements to have simpler single-ended circuitry and fewer parts in the signal path. This also allows elimination of degeneration, “that other negative feedback” in all stages.'

            text: 'Every day, the Pass Labs INT-25 sounded like a purer, more austere instrument than the combination of the Pass Labs XA25 amplifier with any of my in-house preamps. Every day, I noticed how the INT-25 offered a less obstructed and more transparent view of what my source components were excavating from my recordings.'
