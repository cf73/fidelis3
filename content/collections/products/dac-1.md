        text: 'Input signal processing: The DAC1 has one USB, one RCA, one Toslink and one AES input. The USB input is based on Amanero technology and ensures a low-jitter music signal thanks to two precise oscillators, which is then galvanically isolated by capacitive isolator components. The signals arriving at the other inputs are also galvanically isolated and de-jittered by means of transformers. This guarantees that no external interference can affect the sensitive signal.'

        text: 'Digital-to-analog conversion: The task of digital-to-analog conversion is performed by two 1794A converter modules from Burr Brown. For a 5 dB improvement in dynamic range, each channel has its own device. The analog current signal is elaborately converted into a voltage signal in a discrete setup, which is buffered in Class A technology and routed to the output. The DAC1 is fully balanced, i.e. a total of four independent channels are implemented from the two converter modules to the output.'
