        text: 'Low Temperature Class A is notable for the elimination of cross-over distortion, with ultra-fast transient response. Thanks to this development, sonics remain impactful, crisp, and clear, while the amplifier stays cool to the touch. Over time, Low Temperature Class A’s lower operating temperature maximizes the life of the amplifier.'

        text: 'Bass response is tight, powerful, with elimination of phase distortion at lower frequencies thanks to the removal of capacitors in the audio path. The low frequency range extends down to 0 Hz, with a separate protection circuit that disconnects the speakers when the DC level in the signal reaches too high a level.'
