quote: 'Having spent a fair amount of time with both of AVID’s more expensive phono stages, there is definitely a family resemblance here.  All three phono stages have a similar sound: a natural tonal balance with good dynamics and a low noise floor.'

description: '<p>Descended from its bigger relation, our single box phonostage retains the sonic family resemblance, possessing a natural tonal balance with brilliant dynamics and characteristically low background noise.</p><p>Bringing greater ownership accessibility for prudent audiophiles, the Pellar is unusual at this price level, having the flexibility of three gain options for MM, low and high gain MC cartridge types.</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>Having spent a fair amount of time with both of AVID’s more expensive phono stages, the Pulsus and the first generation Pulsare, there is definitely a family resemblance here.&nbsp; All three phono stages have a similar sound: a natural tonal balance with good dynamics and a low noise floor.&nbsp; Much like the AVID turntables, each phono stage in the range has increasingly more dynamic punch, low level detail and low frequency heft.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
