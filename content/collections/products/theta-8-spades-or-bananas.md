        text: "Theta Series signal, digital, and power cables were created using scientific innovation that has established Shunyata Research as a key contributor to the world's top recording studios and heart-surgery labs. Each component, material, and conductor within the Theta Series is custom-designed to extend the boundaries of signal resolution, even when compared to cost-no-object products. Theta Series products further expand upon Shunyata Research's legacy of delivering uncompromising performance at prices that raise expectations for all products in their category."

        text: "Theta Series signal and digital cable products feature continuous-cast Ohno copper. Ohno copper is an ultra-pure conductor drawn using heated molds that cast the wire into a singular crystalline structure. The Ohno conductors used in the Theta Series are then extruded with a fluorocarbon dielectric and custom-shielding elements using Shunyata Research's exclusive PMZ (Precision Matched Impedance) process. This extrusion method tightens the tolerances of the conductor surface, dielectric and the precision placement of the shield. To achieve these finely drawn tolerances, the extrusion and braiding machines must be run at one-quarter normal speed during the manufacturing process."

        text: "Theta speaker cables and power cords feature VTX™ (hollow core) and VTX-Ag™ (pure silver center) conductors, respectively, both with an outer layer of ultra-pure OFE copper for enhanced performance. Finally, all Theta cables are conditioned for 4-days using Shunyata Research's advanced Kinetic Phase Inversion Process™ (KPIPv2™), which conditions conductor metals at a molecular level. Theta Series cables are terminated with Shunyata's custom-designed connectors and cold-soldered terminals. These custom-designed attributes elevate Theta Series performance far beyond expectation, regardless of cost."

        text: 'Theta cables disappear, allowing the system to express sudden dynamic shifts in timing and frequency extension with effortlessness and nuance. A loom of Theta cables allows a complex system of electronics and speakers to speak with a single coherent voice.'

        text: "Like their more affordable Gamma Series counterpart, Theta cables imbue the system with an unassailable sense of coherence, as if everything is in focus, without distortion or hard transients. There is an absence of perceived noise, allowing spectral and textural subtlety to come to the fore. Unlike common copper cables, Theta Series cables deliver explosive dynamics and pitch perfect frequency extension, even when compared to far more expensive cables. Theta's larger gauge VTX™ conductors add weight, dimensionality and an expansive, room-filling sound-stage."
