        text: "The Brio MK7 is a handmade high performance stereo integrated amplifier. The MK7 version of our bestselling amplifier is the most advanced and feature packed Brio ever released. Our team of engineers have completely re-laid the Brio circuit, optimising it for performance and reducing distortion. Housed in a compact, custom half width aluminium case, the Brio MK7 delivers an impressive 50 W per channel into 8Ω and 72 W per channel into 4Ω, which provides ample power to drive the most challenging loudspeakers. The Brio MK7 now includes a Rega designed, on board DAC with two digital\_inputs for greater flexibility with a range of other components. A new mini system remote (compatible with future products) is supplied to operate the standby function, allowing the unit to be powered on and off via the remote handset."
