        text: 'The award winning F501 is the smaller of the two floor-standing loudspeakers in the F500 series but capable of delivering low bass and effortless dynamics from a compact, small footprint cabinet. Bringing additional scale and power to the F500 series signature clarity and articulation, the 150mm proprietary IsoFlareTM driver is accompanied by a matched 150mm bass driver. The IsoFlareTM driver delivers isotropic energy radiation with point source constant directivity providing outstanding stereo imaging, even off axis. Ideal for small to medium-sized rooms, the F501 is supplied with a dedicated plinth incorporating our BassTraxTM Tractrix diffuser system, which integrates bass energy uniformly into the room.'

Enhancing its aesthetic appeal, it has a gently curved front and rear baffle which additionally benefits the acoustic performance by reducing coloration effects.'

            text: "The F501 looks and feels like a mature product that has been brilliantly executed. It proved easy to listen to over long listening sessions. Initial listening excitement sometimes wears off pretty quickly. Not so with the Fyne F501. I continued listening late into the night. With my eyes closed, I could imagine being teleported to the original recording venue, not exactly front row, but a satisfying mid-hall perspective. The F501 delivers outstanding detail resolution, mid-band clarity, and spectacular imaging. Add excellent transient speed and control to the sonic mix, especially when partnered by solid-state amplification, and what you end up with is a mighty-fine Fyne F501—a compelling buy at its price point.\_ \_"
