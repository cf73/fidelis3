        text: 'Silver Eclipse 10 speaker cable adds silver-cladding to the OCC-7N copper of the Eclipse 10 design, providing sound quality closer to the solid silver Platinum Eclipse 10. With twice as many strand groups as Silver Eclipse 8, this cable is second only to the Platinum Eclipse 10 in preserving musical detail, dimensionality and dynamics. The extreme efficiency of the Octo DNA Helix design with superior OCC-7N Silver-clad copper wire conductors, creates a cable that excels at creating vibrant sonic textures and tactile imaging. Available with standard or Biwire termination options.'
