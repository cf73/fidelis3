description: '<p><br>Therefore, we decided to follow a different and more challenging path by designing Lab12 Hpa as a full blooded OTL tube headphone amplifier with the utmost transparent, musical and emotionally engaging heart.<br>And we didn’t just stop there! Hpa is not only a fully enclosed state-of-the-art headphone system which includes a high-grade USB DAC, but it’s also a fully operational high-quality preamplifier with multiple inputs, including USB that can form the heart of any high-end play back system.<br>The Lab12 Hpa tube preamplifier alone encompass all of our knowledge and know how and offers a performance that challenges preamplifiers costing many times the price and brings you a remarkable emotional connection to your music.<br>As all Lab12 products, Hpa comes with two color choices of glass blasting anodizing finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
