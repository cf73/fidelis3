        text: 'The small form factor Antipodes S20 is a new reclocker that can be added to any Antipodes music server that has a USB Audio output. The Antipodes S20''s reclocking engine is the same as the one used in the Antipodes K50. The Antipodes S20 is powered by a standard external brick power supply, but the power is cascade through an internal HSL50 regulator to provide clean power to the reclocker. The performance can be upgraded further by powering it with an Antipodes S60 power supply.'

        text: 'Unfortunately, USB Audio has been negatively impacted by revisions of the USB standard, and the noise introduced by using Ethernet is just as troubling. The Antipodes S20 is the answer to this problem, isolating the USB input electronically from the reclocker circuit and then providing precision re-clocked outputs, powered by Antipodes HSL power supplies.'
