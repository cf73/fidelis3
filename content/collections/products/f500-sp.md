        text: 'Compact and perfectly formed in the UK, the F500SP is the smallest loudspeaker in the UK built Special Production series. Heralding from the award-winning F500, the SP version adds a unique Special Production IsoFlare driver, tuned crossover and premium BassTrax port system, all derived from the prestigious F700 series. This stand-mount loudspeaker’s 6” (150mm) SP IsoFlare driver delivers full-range, point source reproduction across the entire audio spectrum for outstanding detail and class-leading imaging. The multi-fibre cone has exceptional bass reproduction thanks to its innovative twin-magnet motor system and FyneFlute roll surround that reduces cone resonances at the driver termination. The LF output is channeled through a downfiring port onto Fyne’s premium BassTrax Tractrix diffuser system, giving a smooth bass response and easy room integration. The bi-wire connection panel features a fifth terminal to ground the driver chassis and eliminate amp or cable born RF interference. With enhanced details including anodised aluminium plinth, diamond-cut aluminium driver trim and a deep gloss walnut veneer finish option, the F500SP is Fyne Audio’s most affordable premium UK-made loudspeaker.'
