        text: "Hegel has been perfecting the art of DAC design for more than two decades, and the D50 represents the pinnacle of that expertise. At its core lies the latest model DAC chip - a sophisticated tool with immense potential. But like the raven, one of the few animals capable of using tools with precision, the D50's genius lies in how it wields this technology. Every detail of the circuit design and layout has been meticulously crafted to extract the full potential of the DAC chip, transforming it from a mere component into a masterful instrument. The result is a design that uses this tool to its fullest, unlocking extraordinary sound reproduction."

        text: 'The D50 takes extraordinary measures to ensure the purity of its sound reproduction. Its power management is designed to silence noise and deliver clean energy to every part of the device. Advanced filters on the power input eliminate noise from the mains, and when connected to a grounded power outlet, this filtering can even enhance the performance of other equipment in the same circuit. To eliminate electrical noise even further, the D50 employs two low-noise toroidal transformers. One delivers power to the noisier digital processes and standby functionality while the other is dedicated to the sensitive analog and digital components. Both transformers are shielded by thick steel and placed far from any sensitive electronics and their output is also filtered, ensuring the D50 operates with the purest power, allowing its performance to take flight.'

        text: 'At Hegel, we approach circuit board design with meticulous attention to detail, ensuring the best possible performance. In the D50, even the routing features rounded corners to minimize impedance drops and reduce radiation, reflecting our commitment to precision. However, the real innovation lies in how the D50 processes incoming digital signals before converting them to analog. The AES/EBU input features a unique RS422 receiver balanced by a transformer, allowing it to handle both weak and strong signals flawlessly, free of jitter and time delays.'

        text: 'For SPDIF-based inputs, signals are received on a custom-designed card that unpacks the I2S data. While this process is inherently noisy and prone to timing errors, the D50 addresses these issues with precision. The decoded signals are re-clocked using three dedicated master clocks: one for SPDIF signals, and for USB, separate master clocks for 48k and 44.1k sample rates. Strategically placed to minimize noise, these clocks deliver a perfectly timed signal to the DAC chip, enabling the purest and most accurate digital-to-analog conversion.'

        text: 'The DAC chip itself is thoughtfully perched on a separate board above the rest of the electronics. This elevated placement reduces noise and interference while providing short and unobstructed signal paths. With the D50, every aspect of the design has been carefully engineered to ensure that the signal remains as true to the original as possible. The result is an unaltered and breathtakingly accurate translation from digital to analog.'

        text: "The D50's construction is as solid as it is purposeful. Its aluminum housing provides both durability and a refined appearance and improves sound performance. Premium connectors ensure reliable performance, while aluminum feet with rubber soles guarantee stability. The thick, milled aluminum front plate conceals the buttons for an unbroken, elegant facade. Meanwhile, a bright, easy-to-read display delivers all the information you need without drawing attention away from the music."

        text: 'Though the D50 operates with the precision of a masterful instrument, using it is effortless. Its advanced input sensing can detect a digital signal and wake the device automatically. You can customize how it responds to new signals, whether to switch inputs or simply power on. Features like automatic standby save energy when the music stops, while a display dimming option keeps the focus where it belongs - on the music. Once set up, the D50 becomes a seamless part of your system, ready to bring your music to life with no distractions.'

            text: 'A new feather in Hegel’s cap, the D50/Raven flies the flag for something that’s less common these days: a fixed-output standalone DAC, sans streaming. The styling makes it an obvious partner for the brand’s pre/power amps or, in ‘DAC Loop’ mode, its integrated models. Regardless, this single-minded separate offers a brilliantly detailed and transparent performance that will surely play well in any system.'
