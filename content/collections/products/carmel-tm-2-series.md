description: '<p>Carmel 2 is the culmination of years of research, and a near-obsessive desire by lead-designer, Yoav Geva, to extend the leading-edge technologies of Sonja and Hailey to a more compact, two-channel loudspeaker. Fully compatible with multichannel audio and home-theater systems, Carmel 2 can stand alone or be combined with other YG Acoustics™ speakers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'

    excerpt: '<p>While the Carmel 2 is a relatively compact loudspeaker, please do not be deceived by its size. This compact and exquisitely made floorstander is a legitimate ultra-high-end loudspeaker—one that offers transparency, detail, neutrality of voicing, and overall refinement comparable to YG Acoustics’ larger and significantly more expensive Hailey and Sonja loudspeakers, but in a smaller package and at a more manageable price. The Carmel 2 is without a doubt an unqualified design triumph.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
