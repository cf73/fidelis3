        text: 'Stratus is Wireworldâ€™s entry-level power conditioning cord, but thanks to the world-class noise-canceling Fluxfield design and ultra-quiet COMPOSILEX 5 insulation, it clearly outperforms high-end audiophile power cords selling for much higher prices. The improvements most often reported by owners include greater clarity, more impactful bass and reduced listening fatigue. The high-end flat design is also more flexible than other shielded 12AWG power cords and the silver-clad plug contacts make quieter, lower loss connections than the Gold and Rhodium used on other audiophile power cords. Since Wireworld power conditioning cords function as filters, longer lengths provide higher performance.'
