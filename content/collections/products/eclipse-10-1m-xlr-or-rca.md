        text: 'Utilizing the same world-class DNA Helix design as its higher priced siblings, Eclipse 10 is the cable for those who refuse to compromise when it comes to preserving the natural timbre and expressive dynamics of instruments and voices. The conductor material in Eclipse 10 is the world’s finest OCC-7N copper. Upgrades over the previous Eclipse 8 cable include twice as many strand groups and ultra-quiet COMPOSILEX 5 insulation. Available with either XLR or RCA cable terminations, the Wireworld Eclipse 10 embodies excellence in audio signal transmission. Custom lengths are available.'
