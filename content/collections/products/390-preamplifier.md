            text: 'The Moon 390 has much to commend it. As a neat way of combining a multitude of components in one neat box it has few rivals. It’s a terrific analogue preamp and a good streamer. The inclusion of Bluetooth is sensible – there are so many people with music stored on portable devices that it’s only right that Moon has tried to make the most of it. It’s possible to build a superb system around this product. Such a set-up would not only sound lovely but offers the kind of neat, uncluttered approach that’s rarely part of high-end hi-fi. For that, Moon deserves a big pat on the back.'
