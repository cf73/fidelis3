        text: "The Harmony produces an extremely low noise floor not always associated with analog playback. From this inky black background music emerges with detailed accurate highs and superb bass resolution. The midrange is rich and the timbre of instruments and voices are real and tangible. The midrange is magical and in complete balance with the upper and lower octaves. When you listen to the Harmony you will get that emotional connection to the music that only superior analog playback can provide.\_\_Pricing is with no tonearm included - multiple options are available."

Because many classic vinyl records predate such precision, the Conductor also provides separate rear-panel pitch adjustments for 33-1/3 and 45 rpm. A robust component in its own right, the speed control isolates the motor drive voltage from the noise, spikes and distortions in your household AC mains, generating a pure sine wave of uncommon stability.'
