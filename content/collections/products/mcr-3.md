        text: 'The MRC-3 is the largest offering in the MRC series, and is designed to provide truly room-filling sound from the same compact footprint as the other MRC column speakers. By using a third seven-inch ceramic cone driver in a 2 ½ way configuration, the MRC-3 effectively eliminates power compression allowing it to play cleanly at very high output levels in larger rooms with larger amplifiers.'

Every component was chosen with purpose. Capacitors and inductors from Mundorf deliver precision and transparency, while oxygen-free, continuous cast copper wiring from Cardas preserves signal integrity with effortless flow.'
