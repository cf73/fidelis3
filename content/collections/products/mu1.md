quote: 'It is supremely transparent, easily able to resolve the most dense passages, movements and songs, and it lifts prodigious amounts of detail, most especially via its AES/EBU (4x) output. It is also natural and richly musical in a way that makes it compelling and immersive and fluid as if an analog rendering.'

        text: 'With the MU1, our goal was to set a new benchmark in music player design. The Linux-based computer system brings solid data integrity. Our in-house-designed FPGA interface board, which forms the heart of the MU1, offers breakthrough performance levels in format conversion and receives automatic updates whenever we have pushed the boundaries again. Needless to say, the MU1 features our trademark ultra-low jitter clock. This is a music player worthy of the name Grimm Audio.'

It is also natural and richly musical in a way that makes it compelling and immersive and fluid as if an analog rendering. There is also a gravitas or weight, if you will, that brings forth palpability—fully fleshed out/real performers and performances. The Grimm Audio MU1’s combined strengths make it quite a formidable streamer.'
