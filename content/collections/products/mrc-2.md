        text: 'Perhaps the sweet spot in the MRC range, the MRC-2 combines the balanced, low distortion presentation of the smaller MRC models with a bit more bass extension and dynamic slam thanks to its use of a second seven-inch ceramic cone driver in a 2 ½ way configuration. The “walk-around the musicians” soundstage from the other MRC models is still very much apparent, but the MRC-2 adds more output capability and lower distortion in the critical bass range.'

Every component was chosen with purpose. Capacitors and inductors from Mundorf deliver precision and transparency, while oxygen-free, continuous cast copper wiring from Cardas preserves signal integrity with effortless flow.'
