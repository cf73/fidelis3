description: '<p>This integrated amplifier sets a new benchmark in significantly narrowing any perceived performance gap between separate components and integrated amplifiers. Advanced technologies and real-world testing combine to create the INT-60 which presents 60 glorious watts per channel into 8 ohms, and doesn''t leave class A until 30 watts thanks to its high-bias operation. This larger class A operating envelope brings lower distortion and greater loudspeaker control, delivering higher quality musical fidelity for your enjoyment.</p>'
