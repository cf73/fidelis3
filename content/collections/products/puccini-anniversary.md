  What is beyond a doubt is that the Puccini Anniversary keeps your speakers under strict control. It uses
  its power to ensure they start and stop in a precise manner, and thus enhances their ability to image and
  focus a soundstage, while at the same time keeping rhythm sections as tight as they are rich.

        text: 'Heavy metal chassis, aluminum front panel with 14mm thickness, remote control. Volume control with an encoder that communicates with the four digital high precision Analog Devices potentiometers(two per channel). Volume with four possible curves selectable according to the sensitivity of the speakers. Indications of volume level and selected input, thanks white LEDs with brightness adjustable on two levels, or switched off. Inputs with high-quality gold-plated RCA connectors with Teflon insulation, soldered directly to the input''s board and activated via signal relays. All stages of the amplifier on separate boards. Printed circuit boards have golden copper footprints with double thikness compared to standard PCBs in order to increase the electrical conductivity. Fully dual-mono circuitry. Transformer power 700VA, six pairs of ON-Semiconductor power transistors (three per channel). All internal wiring with pure solid 7N OCC copper conductors, military standard resistors, audiograde polypropylene capacitors, copper binding posts gold plated.'
