        text: "The\_Ania was inspired by the success of the Apheta 2 and Aphelion MC cartridges. Using the same exceptionally complex hand wound micro coil found in the rest of the range, the Ania is housed in a unique PPS highly rigid body, ensuring accurate construction and\_Rega's three point fixing method ensuring optimum connection to the headshell and automatic setting for overhang. The new body is\_protected by\_a CAD designed, clear rigid cover to protect the internal fine wires,\_making handling whilst fitting, safe and risk free.The Ania features a super high-powered, neodymium magnet\_and\_a coil meticulously hand wound on to an iron cross. This miniature assembly\_allows us\_greater freedom to track the vinyl groove\_ensuring even more detail is extracted from\_the vinyl."

        text: "Rega’s Moving Coil cartridge design is unique in its approach to achieving an ultra-low mass generator which is undamped (no tie wire) using a unique rhomboid pivot for the cantilever powered by a purpose designed, exclusive to\_Rega,\_Neodymium magnet system. This type of design requires a zero-tolerance engineered cartridge body which is Rega’s area of expertise and with the\_Apheta\_2 and Aphelion products these bodies are machined from one piece of the highest quality\_aluminium. This is a difficult and expensive process requiring all of Rega’s forty-four years of experience to achieve. In particular, the “zero”\_tolerancing\_of the body is required in the alignment and dimension of the pivot pad mounting hole and the magnet mechanism mounting hole relationship."

        text: "When we decided to produce a Moving Coil cartridge at half the cost of the\_Apheta\_2, the special\_aluminium\_body could not be used, it was simply too expensive. The solution lay in an unusual polymer/glass combination called\_Polyphenylene\_Sulphide\_(PPS-Fortron). With 40% glass, this material could be\_moulded\_and would solve the cost problem. The special attributes of this material are its hardness and stability in shape and dimension post\_moulding,\_both critical for the performance of\_Ania. Now came the challenge.\_Rega\_designed and\_prototyped\_using SLA systems in just a few months, proving the validity of the design direction."

        text: "Now we had to design a production\_mould\_tool capable of extreme accuracy and long life. PPS is a difficult polymer to\_mould\_and requires special attention to how the\_mould\_tool operates. Couple this to an almost\_unmouldable complex shape of the\_Ania\_body and a very considerable challenge faced the\_Rega\_engineers and the toolmakers chosen. The toolmakers are of the highest technical skill level, using the most accurate Swiss\_EDM CNC machines, their regular customers being the military and medical industries, routinely working down to a micron (one thousandth of a\_millimetre).To achieve this intricate body shape required the most complex high pressure injection\_mould\_tool that\_Rega\_has ever designed. The tool has eight major parts, four of which must move in perfect\_synchronicity\_with each other to achieve each cartridge body. The design and manufacture of this “work of art” took an entire year to produce and was made exclusively by the most senior toolmaker requiring all his lifetime of artisanal experience."
