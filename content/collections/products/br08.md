quote: 'In overall terms, these Triangles are exceptional, and certainly good enough to challenge the very best at this price. They’re happy playing all genres of music and do it with a charm that’s addictive. We advise listening to them before buying any other floor-standers at this price. You’ll be thankful you did.'
