            text: 'They are small enough to fit anywhere. Fortunately, they play with confident conviction, so that you do not notice the lack of physics so well. Minima Amator II goes deeper in the bass than you think, and they play divinely beautiful on music where vocals are the most prominent instrument. There are small speakers that can play louder, with more bass dynamics, but few that have such fine qualities on perhaps especially acoustic music. Classical and jazz, for example. There are at least very few speakers in this class, if any, that are so elaborately made. It does not contribute insignificantly to the joy of ownership'
