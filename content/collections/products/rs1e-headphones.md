quote: 'I''ll say it''s been improved, In fact the RS-1 puts headphone performance into a new perspective-it highlights the brilliance of music, while retaining a musical naturalness that only a handful of truly reference loudspeakers could ever hope to get a handle on.'

        text: "The RS1e\_from Grado\_uses a\_different species of handcrafted mahogany from our previous models. The earpieces utilize an\_intricate curing process that optimizes the tonal quality while giving them a new look. The RS1e\_places\_a 50mm dynamic transducer and\_an 8 conductor cable design\_in an open-air configuration. The result is a smooth, controlled, and coherent sound with detailed dynamics. Frequency response ranges from 12-30 kHz and the drivers are matched to 0.05dB. Weighing 9oz, the headphones are an example of the wonders of Mother Nature with a gorgeous\_light mahogany look. The RS1e is a masterpiece in the Grado collection"
