quote: 'It has a remarkably easy and accessible nature, one that makes music enjoyable, natural and emotionally communicative. It doesn''t amaze you with this or that special talent, just pulls your attention away from the speaker and into the music. Even in 2022, there are precious few designs that do this at or near its price.'
