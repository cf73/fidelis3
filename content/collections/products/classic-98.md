        text: 'Classic 98 holds a distinctive place within the REL pantheon. While not a part of any regular line of REL products, instead, it is its very own solution for anyone who owns and loves vintage audio gear, or its modern equivalents that we refer to as retro. With different aspirations, Classic 98 offers a slightly softer touch, delivering a broad carpet of room-filling bass. While it might trade off a touch of the speed, clarity, and deepest bass that our standard models, like the T/9x, are known for, it compensates with its inviting warmth. Classic 98 beckons you to put on a record, pour a cherished drink, recline in a comfortable chair, and relax into the music. Its classic natural walnut veneer and mid-century modern styling complements a wide range of decors. It’s also easy to place and use. One reviewer aptly dubbed it as “the audiophile‘s ultimate guilty pleasure.”'
