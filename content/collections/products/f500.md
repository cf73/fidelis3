        text: 'An out and out purist audiophile design, the stand-mount F500 utilises a single 150 mm IsoFlareTM point source driver in a compact, ported cabinet. Offering precise imaging and intimate detailing, the F500 is ideal for small to medium listening rooms. Incorporating a down-firing port, bass energy is evenly dissipated into the room with our BassTraxTM Tractrix diffuser system.'

            text: "Whether it’s acoustic, jazz, rock or electronic the 500’s delivered well for me, indeed very well for their class, and will stand up to many at a loftier price point in my opinion. Clarity and refinement where it matters, air and strength in equal measure – all down to that single point driver and superbly executed porting. Close your eyes and you will forget the position of your speakers and maybe even that they are stand mounts – or in fact that you are listening to speakers at all instead of sitting mid-row in red light, dim and cozy jazz club or gig joint.\_\_"
