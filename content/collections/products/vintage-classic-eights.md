quote: 'The first feeds back to that effortless heft. Even at late night, low level sort of volumes, the Classic VIII sounds big and room filling in what it does. The second is that there’s an ability to handle dynamics that can make some rivals sound a bit broken.'

        text: 'Tall, slim and elegant, the Vintage Classic VIII builds on the SM version with a larger floorstanding cabinet for a fuller, richer and more engaging sound. True to the Vintage Classic Series, the VIII is built within a rectangular cabinet with rich walnut veneer panels and striking baffle detail, including anodised gold trim and analogue control knobs set on a dedicated panel detailing frequency response graphs. Using the 200mm (8”) Vintage Classic IsoFlare with FyneFlute roll surround and proven 25mm magnesium dome compression tweeter, this sumptuously retro design integrates a smaller form factor BassTrax porting system to deliver phenomenal bass from the relatively compact cabinet. Finished with the Vintage Classic woven cloth grille, the VIII will integrate seamlessly into any room.'
