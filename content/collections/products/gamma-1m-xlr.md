        text: "Occasionally, products come along that represent a paradigm shift within a given category. Using 25 years worth of Shunyata Research's documented science, experience and innovation, Gamma Series cables are poised to upend price and performance axioms within the cable industry. Shunyata Research has made critical advancements in conductor science and applied them to Gamma Series cables, elevating performance far beyond expectation. Perhaps more than any other product in Shunyata Research's history, Gamma Series cables demand to be heard even when compared to cables two to three times the cost."

        text: "Gamma signal and digital cables are made with the finest conductors available. Single-crystal, continuous cast Ohno copper is an ultra-pure conductor normally found in far more expensive cables. Ohno conductors are extruded using Shunyata Research's exclusive PMZ (Precision Matched Impedance) process. This extrusion method tightens the tolerances of the conductor surfaces, dielectric extrusions, and the precision of the braided shield. All are held to minute tolerances. The extrusion and braiding machines must be run at one-quarter speed during the manufacturing process. Finally, all Gamma cables are conditioned for 4 days using advanced Kinetic Phase Inversion Process (KPIP v2™)."

        text: "If choosing a single word to encapsulate the sound of a Gamma Series cable system, it would be coherence. Every aspect of Gamma cable system performance simply flows with the ease and clarity of a single voice. Textural and tonal nuance is balanced perfectly against Gamma's explosive, dynamic nature. Gamma cable systems never sound forward, bright, aggressive or edgy. However, what truly separates Gamma cables from all others, regardless of cost, is their self-effacing alacrity, timing accuracy, dynamic punch and frequency extension. Most pure-copper cables, even expensive models, may sound warm, rich, and full bodied at the expense of accurate timing, dynamics and frequency extension. Gamma cables sound very natural, but are surprisingly agile, athletic and entirely unforced with regard to expressing frequency extension, timing, weight and authority in the low octaves. Gamma cables do all of this without calling attention to themselves, allowing the purity of the sound to take center stage."
