        text: 'The Børresen X series loudspeakers are not only a new entry-level into the Børresen universe, but also represents a real revolution in quality and performance in its price range. These speakers are created based on all the knowledge collected in the process of the creation of the M, 0 and Z-series. You´ll find components from these exclusive series in this Børresen X series loudspeakers – for instance the brand new Spread-tow carbon membrane, the highly praised Børresen ribbon tweeter and the use of copper caps in the magnetic motor system.'

        text: 'The combination of these materials gives this membrane its unique properties. The spread-tow carbon fiber was designed to provide a skin with optimal stiffness. This unique feature of the membrane reduces sound-disturbing vibrations and resonances to unprecedented levels. The aramid honeycomb also has the best stiffness-to-weight ratio in the vertical direction. A flat response membrane in terms of resonances paved the way to build a very transparent loudspeaker with a reduced size of the magnetic motor system to optimize costs'

        text: 'In the X3 magnet motor system, we use double copper caps on the pole rings to achieve high flux and low inductance. The use of copper caps has been adopted from the Børresen Z-series. Copper produces a response to flux changes – the better the counter-effect of these copper rings, the flatter the inductance curve, and the lower the electro-magnetic resonance. In addition, lower inductance also means fewer spikes in the impedance curve. Both result in a lower load on the amplifier. To ensure high efficiency, the X3 has two pole rings. This causes the loss of some flux, which reduces efficiency, but this is compensated for by a larger magnet.'

        text: 'The tweeter chosen for the Børresen X3 has the same design used in all other Børresen loudspeaker series. However, there is a reduction in magnet and iron mass. This is possible due to the extremely high efficiency of the original tweeter design. As a result, the efficiency has dropped only slightly from the exceptional 94 dB to 90 dB, but this is still an amazing efficiency for a tweeter.'

        text: 'The X6 is equipped with 6 of the 4.5″ X-series drivers. These drivers are interconnected so that two units work together as bass/midrange and 4 units work together as bass speaker drivers. This approach ultimately results in increased speed, precision, and depth, which enriches the speaker with much more musicality.'

        text: 'The surface of the cabinet is finished in black or white piano lacquer and reinforced with carbon fiber inserts. The cabinet is made of a heavily braced wood composite material that has the property of eliminating sound distortion. The material used for the cabinet also reduces mechanical influences, especially hysteresis. The sonic result is clearly audible. The Børresen X3 cabinet has six bass reflex ports. The tweeter is vented to compensate for the air pressure that builds up. The bass section consists of tuned ports calibrated for musically relevant frequencies.'
