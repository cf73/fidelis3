quote: 'The Sonetto V is the best of all worlds, as it does seem to  combine what was good about the Venere – a sense of ‘directness’ and purpose of sound... and the lower price, of course – with the increased refinement and top-end openness of the Olympica models.'

        text: 'The midrange design of the Sonetto V builds upon the Sonus faber Suprema midrange technology. It incorporates the distinct untainted Camelia diaphragm, renowned for its clarity and precision. Additionally, the inclusion of a carefully engineered aluminum phase plug ensures optimal dispersion and coherence. The result is an immersive and lifelike listening experience emblematic of the Natural Sound known as “The Voice of Sonus faber.”'

            text: "The Sonetto V is at the perfect junction in audio. It draws more than you might think from the Olympica loudspeakers in terms of outright sound quality but does so at a fraction of the cost of a similar Olympica speaker design, and it does all this while carving out its own elegant aesthetic and sonic performance that is extremely entertaining, especially to those who might never fully embrace the ‘live, unamplified music’ ethos of traditional high-end.\_"
