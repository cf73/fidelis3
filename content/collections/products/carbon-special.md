  If you already have a decent system, have some understanding about the harmonic behavior of the frequency range,
  and are looking to get more fun out of your music collection, this is probably the least expensive and most comprehensive way to do it.

              I was genuinely smitten with results achieved by the REL Carbon Special
              when partnered with the big B&Ws. If those were the only speaker I used,
              I would probably have to acquire one. Improving so much on midrange and
              treble coming from a large floor-standing speaker by using a subwoofer might
              look like cheating to many. It is not. If you already have a decent system, have
              some understanding about the harmonic behavior of the frequency range,
              and are looking to get more fun out of your music collection, this is probably
              the least expensive and most comprehensive way to do it.
