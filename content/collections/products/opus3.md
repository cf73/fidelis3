description: '<h3><br></h3><h3>When it comes to the Opus3, there are a few “firsts”. This is the first cartridge built with a maple wood housing, as well as the first to use what we learned with our high-end cartridges at such an entry-level price. The housing is a new shape but still keeps the wood working in tandem with the cartridge inside. This is also the first cartridge built specifically with the Timbre Series in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><h3>Specifications:</h3><p>Body:&nbsp;Maple Wood</p><ul><li>Cantilever: Aluminum / Elliptical Diamond</li><li>Output:<br>High 4.0mV @5 CMV (45)<br>Low&nbsp; 1.0mV @5 CMV (45)&nbsp;</li><li>Inductance:<br>High Output 55mH<br>Low Output&nbsp; 6mH</li><li>Resistance:<br>High Output&nbsp; 660 ohms<br>Low Output&nbsp; &nbsp;70 ohms</li></ul><ul><li>Input Load: 10k-47k ohms</li><li>Cartridge Weight: 8 grams</li><li>Tracking Force: 1.6-1.9 grams</li><li>Compliance: 20μm/mN</li><li>Channel Separation: Average 30db – 10-30k Hz</li><li>Controlled Frequency Response: 10-60 kHz</li><li>Non-Sensitive to Capacitive Load</li><li>Builds: High Output, Low Output, Mono</li></ul>'
