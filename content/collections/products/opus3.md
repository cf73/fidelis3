        text: "When it comes to the Opus3, there are a few “firsts”. This is the first cartridge built with a maple wood housing, as well as the first to use what we learned with our high-end cartridges at such an entry-level price. The housing is a new shape but still keeps the wood working in tandem with the cartridge inside. This is also the first cartridge built specifically with the Timbre Series in mind.\_\_"
