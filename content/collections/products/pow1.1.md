quote: 'The Pow1 LPSU made a huge improvement to the sound of the already thrilling Merason Frerot. The music simply expanded in every direction, bigger, more transparent, more finger-poking realistic. That incredible digital sound at those high-end shows, the one that eluded me at home? This was it, finally.'

        text: 'We are very happy to announce the anticipated release of the Merason pow1 Linear Power Supply for the Frerot DAC. The pow1 generates -12V and +12V, both regulated in 2 ways, the second regulation being particularly low-noise and discrete, as well as +8.3V. Other features are the rectifier diodes built into the pow1 for the two 12V. These are special types which, in contrast to usual rectifier diodes, do not produce any spikes and thus no interference in the supply. The reference voltage for the regulation of the two 12V is generated by a precise integrated circuit instead of using the usual Zener diodes. This gives the advantage of a supply that is exactly matched to the needs of the frérot: The output stage of the frérot is powered directly by the pow1. In addition, the pow1 is robust and elaborately constructed with a toroidal transformer manufactured according to Merason’s specifications, has a metal housing with a shielding cover and is swiss made.'

        text: 'The Merason Pow1 connects to the "Alt Power" DIN port on the back of the unit. This differs from the DC plug input on the back in that the Alt power port allows the Pow1 to send power directly to the individual power rails inside the Frerot from the individual supplies inside the Pow1. The design of the Pow1, plus the implementation with the Frerot give the Pow1 an advantage over any other 9 volt DC power supply that must use the 2.5mm DC plug.'
