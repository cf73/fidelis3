            text: 'To my way of thinking, the 3.7i is easily one of the greatest performers I’ve yet heard in its price class—in large part because it does so many things right and so few things wrong. True, the 3.7i needs quite a bit of space and a lot of power to give of its best, but meet those requirements and the Maggies will serve up the sorts of rich, rare, and refined listening experiences typically associated with loudspeakers several times their price.'
