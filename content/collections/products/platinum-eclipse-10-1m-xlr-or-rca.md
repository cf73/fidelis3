        text: 'This is the world’s most refined interconnect cable design built with the ultimate conductor material, Ohno Continuous Cast 7N solid silver. Supremely transparent, with breathtaking dynamics and holographic imaging, Platinum Eclipse 10 provides the closest sound to the ultimate purity of a direct connection. Improvements over the previous Series 8 cable include doubling the number of strand groups, which provides greater low-level resolution, tonal richness and three-dimensionality. Ultra-quiet COMPOSILEX 5 insulation and Grain-Optimized conductors preserve purity and image focus. Patented Carbon fiber RCA plugs add a level of high-tech elegance that makes these exceptional cables look as good as they sound. Upgrade your system with customizable length and termination options of XLR or RCA for your perfect pair of interconnect cables.'
