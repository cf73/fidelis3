        text: "High in resolution, low in distortion, with enough bass and treble (of superlatively high quality) to satisfy anyone save a headbanger, and a midrange that reproduces well-recorded voices and acoustic instruments with jaw-dropping realism, it is one of those \"sweet-spot\" wonders that pops up every decade or two.\_ The 1.7 give you a generous taste of everything its bigger and more expensive Maggie brothers are capable of for a fraction of what you'd pay for the same wonderment in a top-line dynamic speaker.\_"

It is a true high-end product that will be especially appreciated by those who know and treasure the beauty of live music. The use of the same improved drive elements throughout the frequency expanse works very well. The 1.7i also retains the spatial quality of live music. As Magnepan states, the company has produced a highly phase-coherent speaker without resorting to a complex crossover network (and it shows).'

            text: "In summary, this is a device that does not get in the way of the music. Rather it retains most of the musical information passing through it. It is clear, detailed, and enjoyably realistic. The 1.7i affords a true high-end listening experience for far less cost than sonically competitive speakers. It is a gem and a real bargain.\_"
