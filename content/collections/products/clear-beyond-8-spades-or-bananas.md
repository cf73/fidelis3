        text: 'Based on the flagship Clear speaker cable and developed to go beyond reference performance in cost no object systems where the speakers require large amounts of current flow, Clear Beyond speaker is absolutely neutral and transparent. Perfectly balanced with articulate lows and delicate highs. Amazing dynamics with zero compression. This cable is like running two pairs of Clear Speaker inside one jacket and can be internally bi-wired or bi-amped.'
