        text: "A pair of 12AT7 and 12BH7A dual triode vacuum tubes power the compact MHA200. The 12AT7 vacuum tubes amplify the incoming audio signal while the 12BH7A tubes provide the power to drive the output to your headphones with low distortion. The MHA200 uses a pair of our Unity Coupled Circuit output transformers to deliver pristine audio to your ears. Our Unity Coupled Circuit is the same technology McIntosh was founded on in 1949 and is still used in our vaunted full-size home audio vacuum tube amplifiers such as the timeless\_MC275\_and the more recent\_MC1502. Indeed, the MHA200 shares many physical design traits with the aforementioned vacuum tube amplifiers."
