quote: 'All-in-one solutions are a deceptively complicated business, but the Moon ACE makes the job look simple. Easily moving between analog and digital platforms, it proved to be a sophisticated and highly musical workhorse, ran strongly without incident, and offered performance and flexibility that often out-stripped the competition.'
