quote: 'Due to some terrific design and engineering, the Sonus faber Sonetto III produces much bigger sound than a speaker its size has a right to. If you’re tight on space and thought you’d have to settle for a bookshelf design, think again.'

            text: 'The Sonetto IIIs could well be the answer. And if you have placement restrictions, the Sonettos are more forgiving than most floorstanders. The Sonetto IIIs have such a wonderful ability to reproduce lifelike midrange and midbass that you''ll often forget you''re listening to speakers.'
