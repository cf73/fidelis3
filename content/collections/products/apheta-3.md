description: '<p>For more than 15 years Rega has been perfecting its unique designs of moving coil cartridges. We have pioneered undamped micro mass generation systems coupled with high integrity jointless bodies. In recent times we have achieved new levels of power from rare earth magnets. This 15 year evolution using the latest technological manufacturing process and recognized laws bought us the hugely successful Apheta 2.With the Apheta 3 we have pushed another boundary, for several years we have been developing state of the the art diamond profiles of a “Fine Line” design mounted through 90 degrees (the same technique used in our Aphelion 2 reference model) this work has resulted in Apheta 3 extracting even more detail from the record groove which of course translates into more music.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Apheta 3 features a super high-powered, neodymium magnet and a coil meticulously hand wound on an iron cross that is fifty percent smaller than the MK1 model. This weight reduction allows us greater freedom to track the vinyl groove. The Apheta 3 is housed within a completely redesigned, single piece, aluminium anodised body and protected by a CAD designed, smoked rigid cover to protect the internal fine wires, making handling whilst fitting, safe and risk free. The Apheta 3 is the perfect partner for the latest Planar 8 and Planar 10 turntables. The Apheta 3 can be supplied factory fitted at a discounted package rate. Please ask your retailer for details.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
