        text: "This headphone has\_sizable rear air flow through a metal screen, while utilizing Grado's larger ear cushion and\_closely matched drivers.\_The result is a broad soundstage\_free from colorations. The way the SR225e's new driver, cable and plastic housing move air and react to sound vibrations\_is virtually unaffected by transient distortions. Bass, midrange and treble are all more\_wide open and you will enjoy the fine tonal spread and balance. The SR225e will produce a sound that is pure Grado, with warm harmonic colors, rich full bodied vocals, excellent dynamics, and an ultra-smooth top end."
