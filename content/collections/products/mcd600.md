        text: 'Enjoy hours of listening pleasure with the MCD600 SACD/CD Player. At the heart of the MCD600 is a newly designed digital circuit highlighted by a new premium 8-channel, 32-bit PCM/DSD digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The DAC is used in Quad Balanced mode, with 4 DAC channels allocated to each of the left and right audio channels, resulting in truly exceptional sound reproduction. All PCM signals are up-sampled up to 32-bit/384kHz.'

        text: 'A twin laser optical pickup assures optimal reading of all common disc types, including SACD, CD, CD-R/RW and DVD-R. A new disc transport with a precision die-cast aluminum tray provides smooth and quiet disc handling, while an advanced digital servo provides fast, quiet and accurate operation. The disc’s audio data is read at twice the normal rate insuring better disc tracking and error correction processing. Power Control and data ports allow for seamless integration with other McIntosh system components.'

            text: 'The McIntosh MCD600 excels at the things it does do. That DAC is a wonder. The MCD600 is a beautiful product—especially if you’re in love with the classic McIntosh look. If you’re an audiophile who still wants to listen to a large CD collection with a great-sounding player, take a look at the MCD600. If you’re an audiophile who, like me, is looking for a way to integrate digital into an otherwise analog system, take a look at the MCD600. If you love all things McIntosh, this is the CD player you should own.'
