        text: 'The IOTA incorporates the implementation of radical and unorthodox thinking in order to offer the same integrity and musical capability that distinguishes all Neat loudspeakers. It is especially suited to the current crop of all-in-one streaming systems, from which a very high level of sound quality can be attained, but space is usually at a premium.'

            text: 'The Neat Acoustics Iota is one serious little loudspeaker and ideal for connoisseurs with seriously limited space. As an aside, I don’t know how many times I became so lost in the music that these little marvels produced that I was fooled into thinking I was listening to the much larger set of speakers residing in my listening room. That’s just what the Iota does. And that’s what I call one Neat trick. Highly recommended.'
