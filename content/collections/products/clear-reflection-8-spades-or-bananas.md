        text: 'Clear Reflection speaker cable perfectly balances speed, detail, and dynamics with transparency, musicality and warmth. Many refer to it as the warmer speaker cable in the Clear product range because it has a tight grip on the top octaves. It pairs well with larger amps and demanding speakers but has the grace to also work in less demanding situations. Clear Reflection is the only black cable in the Clear range and has beautiful copper color accents.'
