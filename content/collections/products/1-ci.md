        text: "The Model 1Ci+ is living proof that designing and building a great entry-level speaker doesn't require as much ingenuity and skill as a cost-no-object flagship- it requires even more! The Model 1Ci is a time- and phase-correct speaker constructed in such a way that the alignment and positioning of the drivers allow a point-source wave front and maximize the phase coherence of the loudspeaker at the listening position. Dimensional Purity in a shockingly affordable full-range speaker.\_\_"

              We are very pleased to
              award the Vandersteen 1Ci
              one of our Exceptional Value
              Awards for 2014. These
              speakers are so enjoyable
              that, if your high-end journey
              stopped right here, you’d
              be a pretty happy human
              being. Even if you are a highly
              experienced audiophile and
              you haven’t heard these, you
              owe it to yourself to check
              them out. I guarantee you’ll be
              very surprised for the better.
              They redefine what is possible
              for a modest price.
