        text: 'The SIGMA-X QR edition is the highest performing SIGMA-X model. It includes patented QR/BB technology descended from the ultimate OMEGA QR along with Gen3 NR noise reduction technology. It is particularly suited to use with high powered amplifiers but can be used for source and digital equipment when only the highest levels of performance are demanded.'

        text: 'SIGMA-X XC was designed specifically for use as a wall-connection power cord for use with Shunyata Research power distributors. Due to the extensive levels of filtering in Shunyata Research designed power distributors, NR filters are not needed at the wall connection. For use with other manufacturers power conditioners, the NR models will likely provide a performance benefit.'

        text: 'Have you ever watched a film that was so engrossing and captivating; the performances so real that you forgot you were watching a movie? That would be an apt description of the SIGMA-X power cord’s impact on sound, recording and imaging. There is an immediacy to sound, an immersive rendering of recorded detail that makes it easy to focus on the music and to forget about the recording chain.'

        text: 'The dramatic performance SIGMA-X power cords impart is not subtle or amorphous, it is revelatory and impossible to dismiss. When the recording calls for it, SIGMA-X power cords unleash a perfectly timed storm of three-dimensional weight and dynamic intensity – without a hint of compression or artifice. Perhaps the signature attribute of the SIGMA-X performance is its rendering of an almost gravitational silence within voice, instruments and images on a recording. There is a truth and precision to sound that is unmistakably free of distortion, leaving the listener captivated by an intense connection to favorite music.'
