        text: 'No power cable on the market touts the spare-no-expenses construction, cutting-edge abilities, and benchmark performance provided by the Shunyata Sigma v2 Noise-Reducing (NR) cord. Equipped with a built-in wide-bandwidth CCI noise-filtration system that reduces power-line and component-generated power-supply noise – as well as built-in, second-generation Zitron technology that measurably lowers dielectric distortion while preserving the integrity of the original audio signal – Sigma v2 NR doubles as a power conditioner for the amplifier, preamplifier, or source component to which it''s connected. This is not your father''s – or even your older brother or sister''s – power cable.'

        text: 'First off, Sigma v2 touts several key sonic upgrades over its Product of the Year Award-winning predecessor. While you can read more about the key construction elements below, the use of VTX-Ag provides significant improvements in dynamics, accuracy, and low-level resolution while preserving the subtle tonal, textural, and timbral signatures that bring music to life. Sigma v2 NR also delivers more precise, time-correct presentations distinguished with an authoritative low end, pronounced contrasts, and transparent soundstages. What''s more, carbon-fiber headshells eliminate layers of grain all the while claiming a ridiculously silent background. Last but not least, the redesigned NR v2 broadband filters filter lower in frequency than the original NR filters and are tuned to filter out specific frequencies of noise common to all component power-supply emissions. You''ll hear increased three-dimensional imaging and greater access to extreme low-level details.'

        text: 'Indeed, the U.S.A.-made Sigma v2 NR''s meticulous design and vanishingly low resistance to peak current (DTCD) deliver unparalleled performance when used with even the most current-hungry amps. Shunyata''s Kinetic Phase Inversion Process (KPIP) is a groundbreaking conditioning method that not only eliminates the need for time-consuming burn-in on your end but also elevates the overall fidelity of your system. You will hear invaluable sonic benefits – blacker backgrounds, lifelike detail, inner depth, explosive dynamics, revealing textures – when listening to music with Sigma v2 NR in your setup. And now, you won''t have to wait hours and hours for it to happen.'

        text: 'So, what''s exactly in Sigma v2 NR? Patented technology, exclusive metal treatments, and customized parts that outshine the construction involved with competitive products. It all starts with an ultra-pure OFE copper tube with a pure silver conductor at the center of the hollow core – all woven into massive, six-gauge VTX-Ag conductors linked to CopperCONN connectors. The latter contain true carbon-fiber headshells with anti-vibration qualities and pure copper contacts that claim higher conductivity principles than common plated brass and bronze contacts. Advanced fluorocarbon dielectrics and sonic welding that mitigates junction points complete a power cord that combines meaningful innovations, objective measurement, an artisan''s eye for detail, and discernible science in the name of provable, standard-setting performance.'

        text: 'Noise is an insidious problem that originates from many sources, including audio components themselves. Shunyata Research power cords employ proprietary internal noise-reduction filters that intercept noise, preventing it from propagating to other components. NR filters are specifically engineered to be non-reactive and compatible with all power-supply designs, including high-power amplifiers. This multi-element, wide-bandwidth noise-reduction technology was developed by Shunyata Research''s medical division, Clear Image Scientific, to improve the performance of medical imaging systems in cardiology and neurosurgery.'
