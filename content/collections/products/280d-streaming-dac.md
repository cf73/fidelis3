            text: "I really enjoyed my time with the Simaudio Moon Neo\_280D. I feel it’s a world-beater at its price, with sound quality that approaches, and in some respects exceeds, those of costlier DACs. Yes, it’s more expensive than the Oppo HA-1, and doesn’t offer a headphone amp or preamp functionality, but that shouldn’t concern you if all you need is an audio DAC. Plus, with the optional MiND module, which eliminates the need for a computer, the Neo\_280D’s value increases."

            text: "The Moon Neo\_280D is a well-rounded DAC that handles all musical genres with finesse, but if your tastes lean more toward rock’n’roll and fusion, the Neo\_280D may very well be the DAC for you. My default recommendation in this price range has been the Oppo HA-1, but the Neo\_280D should be right up there for those looking for other options in that price range or higher. As for that market sweet spot that Simaudio is aiming for? I’d say the Moon Neo\_280D is right on target."
