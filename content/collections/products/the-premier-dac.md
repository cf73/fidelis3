            text: 'Now I get why MSB''s DACs appear in so many exhibitors'' rooms at hi-fi shows: the blend of sonic excellence and flexibility places it in the select group that includes Esoteric, dCS, Chord and others of that calibre. Make no mistake: this is a serious investment, but the modular design is a bulwark against obsolescence. Throw in the role of preamp (if you''re all-digital) and the price seems less forbidding. A triumph.'
