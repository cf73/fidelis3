        text: 'Although this is the taller of the two floor-standers in the Motive SX range, the SX1 is nevertheless a compact and elegant model. It will blend discreetly into any living room whilst its performance gives little away to larger and more expensive models.'

        text: 'This loudspeaker uses a two and half-way configuration, with the bass/midrange driver and the tweeter operating within a sealed enclosure. The sub-bass drive unit is housed separately in a reflex-tuned section below. The bass reflex port is fitted to the bottom panel of the cabinet and is vented through an outlet in the stylishly sculpted MDF plinth.'

        text: 'The tweeter is the new and upgraded unit used throughout the Motive SX range and features a huge screened magnet assembly and a 25mm inverted anodized aluminium dome. This type of tweeter is usually only found in more expensive high-end loudspeakers and is therefore an exceptional inclusion to the Motive SX designs.'
