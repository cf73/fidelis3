        text: 'Silver Electra uses the highest purity OCC-7N silver-clad copper conductors and ultra-quiet COMPOSILEX 5 insulation to provide resolution, dynamics, and three-dimensional image focus that are second only to Platinum Electra 10. Among audiophile power cords in its price range, Silver Electra 10’s ability to reveal musical detail and expression outshines the competition. This flexible flat 12 AWG high-end power cable also bends and coils easily. Silver Electra’s premium quality plugs feature supremely conductive Silver-clad contacts for measurably quieter connections than Gold or Rhodium. Since Wireworld power conditioning cords function as filters, longer lengths provide higher performance.'
