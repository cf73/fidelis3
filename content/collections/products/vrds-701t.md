        text: 'This TEAC-original CD drive mechanism reduces rotation vibration of the disc itself as well as unwanted mechanism vibration by clamping the CD to an aluminum turntable with the same diameter and maximizing inertial mass in order to stabilize rotation. Servo current is reduced with the turntable by correcting disc warping and distortion and improving the relative optical axis precision of the pickup and disc pit side. This realizes reduced disc reading errors and creates outstanding audio quality.'
