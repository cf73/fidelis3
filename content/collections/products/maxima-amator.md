description: '<p>&nbsp;As the third member of the Heritage family, we pay homage to our Italian roots<br>and to our artisans as well as the people who are responsible for developing Sonus Faber products.<br>Completely Made in Italy, Maxima Amator is a project started many years ago and abandoned because considered impossible. Today, we achieve that dream: a two-way floor stander concept applied to a solid wood cabinet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'

    type: Review
    excerpt: '<p>Sonus Faber’s target audience for its Heritage Collection, and for the Maxima Amator in particular, is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;audiophiles who are cross-shopping designs from Focal, Magico, and/or Wilson Audio Specialties. This is an artisanal loudspeaker. The marriage of so many materials—solid walnut, leather, brass, marble—into such an evocative form gives the Sonus Faber a presence and a gravitas that are difficult to describe. It’s also a very good loudspeaker, with admirable output down to 35Hz, and a commendably linear, uncolored mid band.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
