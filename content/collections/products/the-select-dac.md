        text: 'With eight Hybrid DACs, we yield an unmatched level of detail, reproducing the musicality, soundstage, and texture of an original performance, bringing the artist to you. A fully balanced, ultra-high precision, discrete ladder DAC architecture ensures each note tells a story. Additionally, MSB’s robust in-house design enables the finest quality playback of PCM and native DSD, while our low impedance circuitry drives your amplification directly without adding coloration or buffering noise. The end result is a digital experience defying expectations.'

            text: 'The new $89,995 DAC is, in my opinion, the most beautifully designed MSB product to date, with a seamless, softly-rounded (but serious-looking) case that can sit on the optional and matching analog and digital power supplies, themselves available for $19,995 extra. There is also a femto clock upgrade for $9,995, and a variety of digital input options, so all told this is one expensive beast with or without the add-ins. Analog output options include balanced and unbalanced and headphones.'
