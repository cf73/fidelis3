        text: "The Planar 10 was inspired by the ultimate Rega turntable, the Naiad. Built around our ultra-light skeletal plinth, constructed from Tancast 8 core and covered in a high-pressure laminate (HPL) skin. The Planar 10 is the first production turntable to use ceramic bracing which provides the ultimate rigid surface for mounting the precision reference RB3000 tonearm and custom central bearing assembly.\_\_"

This supply delivers the ultimate in motor vibration reduction, electronic fine speed adjustment and the convenience of electronic speed change. The Planar 10 is designed to deliver the ultimate in Rega performance by extracting more information from the vinyl groove than ever before.\_\_"
