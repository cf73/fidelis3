        text: 'Like a scaled down version of Clear Beyond Power, Cygnus Power features three well shielded conductors, and a passive noise filter. Although designed for use with source equipment and small-to-medium sized amplifiers, Cygnus Power has the current handling capacity for even larger, tube powered amps. As you would expect, Cygnus Power pairs well with the rest of the Cygnus lineup, and provides many of the benefits of it’s higher-capacity siblings, at a fraction of the price.'
