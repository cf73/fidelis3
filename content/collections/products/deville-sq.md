        text: 'The DeVille SQ (Superior Quality) is the ultimate DeVille. The entire enclosure is made out of solid Pennsylvania ash, either natural (light color) or torrefied (roasted) in either light, medium or dark. The phase plug is cast from a 3D printed sand mold in solid bronze, then patinated, polished and lacquered. Internal wiring is solid silver, and the crossover components are the finest quality.'

            text: 'The Fleetwood DeVille SQ worked well with every kind of music, even my beloved ZZ Top, and made jazz and classical its willing bedfellows. But it''s not for everyone. Beef and brawn are not its calling cards, but rather lucidity, spatial beauty, clarity, dynamics, and precision. I found the sound of the SQ model intoxicating, which made me wonder what degree of SQ magic is present in its $12,600 sibling.'
