quote: 'Big amps that can still sound small, that can combine the control and grip that comes with ample power while still retaining the intimacy and deft agility of smaller amps are few and far between, and the c-j Classic 120SE is one of that rare breed. It’s a quality to be cherished.'

        text: 'This resolve is clearly evident in our new range of Classic amplifiers. Borrowing heavily on the technology of our flagship ART amplifier, the Classic amplifiers preserve the distinctive tonal character of individual instruments and voices, with each clearly located within the overall acoustical environment of the original recording. Musical transients are reproduced with realistic impact, but without artificial enhancement. Like their more costly siblings, the Classic amplifiers capture the emotional impact of the live event, never getting between the listener and the musical performance.'

        text: 'The circuit design for the Classic amplifiers is about as simple as possible, employing just seven vacuum tubes in the Classic Sixty-Two. Single-ended triode voltage gain and inverter stages are coupled to an output stage comprised of a single pair of ultra-linear operated EL34 tubes for each channel. The Classic One-Twenty adds a second pair of output tubes to each channel to achieve twice the output power. Simple but highly effective discrete voltage regulators supply rock-solid stable DC voltage to the critical voltage gain and inverter stages. And speaking of simple, maintenance of the Classic amplifiers could hardly be easier: the owner need only make a simple bias adjustment using the built in bias indicators when installing fresh output tubes.'

        text: 'In this area as well, the Classic amplifiers are leaders in their class. Precision, metal-film resistors yield low noise performance for greatest clarity. Polypropylene and polystyrene capacitors, chosen to achieve a high degree of temporal accuracy, are specified for both the audio cir¬cuits and the regulated plate voltage supplies for the input and inverter stages. The result is an exceptional range of dynamics – reproducing both subtle variations in level as well as dramatic loud crescendos. Our proprietary trans-spectral wide-bandwidth output transformers contribute importantly to the extended, “airy” highs that help distinguish the Classic amplifiers from ordinary tube amplifiers.'
