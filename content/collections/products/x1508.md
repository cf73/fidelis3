        text: "As the entry-level class A/B stereo power .8 amplifier, the X150.8 features many of the same technical and sonic attributes of its larger brethren. It features 150 watts per channel, 100K ohm input impedance and operates “higher” into Class A than its predecessors. But knowing the ear is not a microphone and the brain is not a tape recorder, we've designed this model to bridge the gap between measured performance and outstanding subjective musical experience. Simply put, the X150.8 will compel you to listen to your entire music collection again and again. "
