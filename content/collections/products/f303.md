        text: 'Employing a D’Appolito driver configuration, positioning the tweeter centrally between the two bass / midrange drivers, provides a smooth dispersion characteristic through the critical crossover region. The sweet spot is widened, resulting in enhanced musical performance on or off the loudspeaker’s main axis. Perfect for Hi-Fi or home theatre, the F303 floor-standing speaker won’t disappoint.'
