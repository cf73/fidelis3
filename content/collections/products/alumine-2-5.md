        text: 'The iconic Alumine Two changed speaker design and redefined what was possible from a bookshelf speaker. It achieved this by combining elements that have served as the basis for every Stenheim speaker since: aluminium cabinets, highly efficient drivers and sophisticated crossovers that are designed to be as unobtrusive as possible. The Alumine Two achieves its astonishing musicality partly by virtue of being a two-way design, the crossover only having to deal with two drivers, the tweeter and the bass. In audio, simplicity is the holy grail but extremely difficult to achieve.'

        text: 'Now the Alumine Two.Five takes these same design concepts and applies them to a floorstanding cabinet for greater internal volume and bass extension. The design is still a two-way, eschewing the compromises that may result from a more complicated crossover required to handle multiple different drivers. The purity and simplicity that created the success of the Alumine Two is maintained, but the double bass drivers ensure room-filling sound in larger spaces whilst giving greater extension in the low frequencies.'

        text: 'The easily driven Alumine Two.Five is suitable for a wide range of high-quality amplification and is the ideal partner for even modestly powered systems, such as tube amps, to deliver enthralling music with typical Stenheim clarity, detail and liveliness. It is hand-assembled in our manufacture in Switzerland with quintessential Swiss attention to detail and quality and is designed to perform for decades.'

        text: 'The classically elegant, slim cabinet makes it a beautiful addition to any listening space or living room, complementing any décor, without seeking to be the centre of attention. That is the role performed by the sublime music it produces the moment you hit play.'
