                text: 'Even now many audiophiles are still longing for 300B direct-heated triode valve. We too, were captivated by the charm of this valve. Our approach is to pull out the full potential of 300B valve’s musical soundstage without any additive coloration. As a result, we could achieve a goal of timbral purity and tonal realism by means of 300B’s idiosyncrasy.'
