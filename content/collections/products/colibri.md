        text: "The Colibri C2 is a compact, two-way, ultra high performance loudspeaker system. It combines Avantgarde’s proven sound quality with extreme efficiency and an incredible maximum level (117 dB). The Colibri C2 is built to last: Timeless design, the finest materials, and a focus on superior, stable, precision analog technology that eschews short-lived digital components make the Colibri C2 a product that will perform for years. The Colibri C2's advanced analog transducer technology already exceeds the demands of future digital development. Its compact dimensions and multiple installation options make it easy to integrate even in the smallest rooms. It can be placed directly on the integrated rubber pads or installed using the clever stands and wall mounts. It can be aligned horizontally or vertically, while the integrated, toothed mounting rings allow precise tilt and height adjustments. Suitable for different living environments, the speaker is available in three contrasting color combinations. The system can be further customized via optional finishes for the horn trumpets and speaker grill."
