        text: 'The Shunyata Alpha v2 NR is a power cable in name only. Featuring a wide-bandwidth CCI noise-filtration system that reduces power-line and component-generated power-supply noise – in addition to built-in, second-generation Zitron technology that measurably lowers dielectric distortion while preserving the integrity of the original audio signal – the U.S.A.-made cable doubles as a power conditioner for the amplifier, preamplifier, or source component to which it''s connected. And that says nothing of how its array of patented engineering, exclusive metal treatments, and customized parts translate to unshackled musical performance.'

        text: 'Let''s start with its implementation of VTX-Ag in the eight-gauge conductors, which provides significant improvements in dynamics, accuracy, and low-level resolution while preserving the subtle tonal, textural, and timbral signatures that bring music to life. Alpha v2 NR also delivers more precise, time-correct presentations distinguished with an authoritative low end, pronounced contrasts, and transparent soundstages. What''s more, carbon-fiber connectors eliminate layers of grain all the while claiming a ridiculously silent background. Also, improved NR v2 broadband filters filter lower in frequency than the original NR filters and are tuned to filter out specific frequencies of noise common to all component power-supply emissions. You''ll hear notice increased three-dimensional imaging and greater access to extreme low-level details.'

        text: 'Have a power-hungry amplifier? No problem. Alpha v2 NR''s vanishingly low resistance to peak current (DTCD) provides unparalleled performance even when paired with a component that demands gobs of energy. You also get the advantages of Shunyata''s Kinetic Phase Inversion Process (KPIP), a groundbreaking conditioning method that not only eliminates the need for time-consuming burn-in on your end but also elevates the overall fidelity of your system. You will hear myriad sonic benefits – blacker backgrounds, lifelike detail, inner depth, explosive dynamics, revealing textures. And you won''t have to wait hours and hours for it to happen.'

        text: 'If we take a closer look at the composition of Alpha v2 NR, it starts with an ultra-pure OFE copper tube with a pure silver conductor at the center of the hollow core – all woven into large, eight-gauge VTX-Ag conductors linked to CopperCONN connectors. The latter contain true carbon-fiber headshells with anti-vibration qualities and pure copper contacts that claim higher conductivity principles than common plated brass and bronze contacts. Advanced fluorocarbon dielectrics and sonic welding that mitigates junction points complete a power cord that combines meaningful innovations, objective measurement, an artisan''s eye for detail, and discernible science in the name of provable, standard-setting functionality.'

        text: 'Noise is an insidious problem that originates from many sources, including audio components themselves. Shunyata Research power cords employ proprietary internal noise reduction filters that intercept noise,preventing it from propagating to other components.NR filters are specifically engineered to be non-reactive and compatible with all power supply designs including high-power amplifiers. This multi-element, wide-bandwidth noise-reduction technology was developed by Shunyata Research''s medical division, Clear Image Scientific, to improve the performance of medical imaging systems in cardiology and neurosurgery.'

These connectors are not just beautiful; they functionally reduce micro-distortions due to the carbon fiber''s unique energy absorbing vibration reduction qualities.'

All elements in Reference NR Series power cords, including the wires, contacts, dielectrics and junctions, are tested and optimized using Shunyata Research''s proprietary DTCD Analyzer. This optimization ensures outstanding low-frequency performance as well as dynamic contrasts akin to a live musical event. More than any other design parameter, Shunyata Research''s ability to provide measurable dynamic instantaneous current is unparalleled.'
