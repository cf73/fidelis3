        text: "At last, there is a solution for listeners with smaller living spaces or more efficient systems. Those who want a truly high-performance amplifier in a more manageable package. There are systems and locations where larger amps simply don’t fit or more powerful options are unnecessary and the 1161 Stereo Power Amplifier was developed as a compact, less powerful alternative that gives up nothing in terms of performance.

I don’t know, I can’t make that decision,” I have no reservation saying the Boulder 1161 is one of the best values in high-end audio today.

Given the Boulder 1161s sonic performance, build quality, and that it is as obsolescence proof as a component can be, I find it to be a more than worthy candidate for one of our Exceptional Value Awards for 2019.

Unless of course, you get a hankering for a bigger Boulder…'
