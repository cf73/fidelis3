quote: 'Tracks that don’t have as much low frequency information impress just as much as the ones that do. That’s the magic of the REL Classic 99. Perfect for those of you who love the Classic 98 but feel you needed significantly more due to either using larger speakers or having a bigger room than the 98 could handle.'

        text: 'Classic 99 extends our Classic Line to loftier heights. Richer, bolder, and more powerful? Certainly. Yet 99 is also capable of far greater nuance, air, and resolution than its lesser brethren. For those with more capable systems and larger rooms, Classic 99 delivers advances on every front, while still maintaining the same easy-going, room-filling nature all Classic offerings possess. The high-grade genuine dark walnut veneer complements a variety of decors. Classic 99 delivers this in the same simple, comforting form of Mid-Century Modern design. Perfect for those who welcomed the original, yet were waiting for the next chapter to be written, those who crave even higher performance and the ability to fill larger, grander spaces with a broad carpet of deep bass. You’ll still want to put on a record, pour a favorite drink, sink into your favorite chair, and relax into the music or movie of your choice. Classic 99, for those who waited for more.'
