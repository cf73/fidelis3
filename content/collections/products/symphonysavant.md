        text: 'The Symphony turntable immerses you in an emotional musical experience achievable only with the highest level of analog playback. Central to its performance is the extraordinary harmony of Pure Fidelity’s “hybrid” design. It provides a rich midrange, making instruments and vocals feel real and palpable. Boasting an exceptionally low noise floor, music emerges from an inky black background with detailed highs and excellent bass resolution. In line with a component of such distinction, the deck incorporates our most advanced strategies against shelf-borne vibration and resonance. The result is a musical instrument of rare distinction.'
