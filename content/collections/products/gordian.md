description: '<p>Gordian is a highly configurable noise filtering and power factor correction system that provides subtle filtering through a sophisticated and adaptive network of passive components and an industrial grade power analyzer that uses mathematical analysis of the power line characteristics. There are no audible and negative effects with Gordian in both audible frequency range or with the measured power output and this results in a cleaner and more articulate sound.<br>Gordian can operate as either a highly configurable and sophisticated device or as straight forward, highly automated power distributor/filter with the tap of one single button, whilst three options let you select between auto and manual operation.<br>As all Lab12 products, Gordian also comes with two color choices of glass blasting anodizing finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
