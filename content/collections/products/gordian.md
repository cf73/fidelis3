        text: 'Gordian is a highly configurable noise filtering and power factor correction system that provides subtle filtering through a sophisticated and adaptive network of passive components and an industrial grade power analyzer that uses mathematical analysis of the power line characteristics. There are no audible and negative effects with Gordian in both audible frequency range or with the measured power output and this results in a cleaner and more articulate sound.'
