In fact, there’s absolutely no reason&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to take home an 866. It’s everything you could want and more.</p><p>Two versions are available to suit any system: all-analog for more traditional systems and analog+digital for the streaming digital media listener.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>INPUTS: 3 pairs balanced analog via 3-pin XLR</li><li>DIGITAL INPUTS: Ethernet, USB x 4, AES3 (adaptable to S/PDIF), Toslink (optical), WiFi</li><li>OUTPUTS: 0.25" (6 mm) binding posts</li><li>CONTINUOUS POWER: 8 OHMS - 200W</li><li>PEAK POWER:&nbsp; 8 OHMS - 250W</li></ul>'

    excerpt: '<p>Considering how much of an improvement the 866 offers over the 865, Boulder could be charging much more for the privilege. Not only does it sound better, but it''s more powerful, stylish and affordable than its predecessor, and with the option to add a DAC, this is a real winner.</p>'
