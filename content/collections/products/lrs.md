        text: 'The $995 LRS+ (add another $289 for a pair of its optional and, IMO, essential steel stands) is a new and improved version of Maggie’s LRS (Little Ribbon Speaker)—a four-foot-tall, one-foot-wide, one-inch-thick “baby” Magnepan, expressly designed to fit into smaller, condo-like spaces. Previously, the littlest Maggies, such as the MMGs, used a mix of quasi-ribbon tweeter and planar-magnetic mid/woof panels.'
