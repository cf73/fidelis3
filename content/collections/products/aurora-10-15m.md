        text: 'Aurora power conditioning cord is an upgrade over the Stratus that adds silver on the OFC conductors to provide more vivid tone color and greater 3D imaging precision. Thanks to the breakthrough upgrade of COMPOSILEX 5 insulation, this high-end power cord compares favorably with some of the worldâ€™s most expensive audiophile power cords. The flexible flat design bends and coils easily, so excess length is never an issue. That advantage is especially helpful because Wireworld power cords function as filters and longer lengths provide higher performance.'
