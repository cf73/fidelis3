    type: Review
    excerpt: '<p><strong>And the sound !</strong>&nbsp;– My first thought whenever I listen to an Exposure product is just how damned neutral they generally are. This is definitely the case with the 2510, unlike some amps that have a definite ‘color’. Initially it’s slightly disarming…it just does everything sort of really well. It’s annoying because as a reviewer you can’t grab any one aspect of performance and carry on about it. For instance, the overall sound is very clean, smooth, and obviously fully extended at both ends of the spectrum. There is little grit or grain, and maybe its even a smidge ‘sweet’. The old “straight wire with gain” comes to mind. Stereo-wise, it’s big and wide, there is plenty of detail and it’s very fast. Although, I reckon it takes a few minutes to adjust to this lack of color. In the end, 20 minutes in and I’m loving it, playing all sorts of things and enjoying the music.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
