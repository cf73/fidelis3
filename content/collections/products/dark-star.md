        text: 'The name sounds a bit like something out of a Star Wars movie. Which was a deliberate choice. This is where our founder Jochen RÃ¤ke first became friends with the material POM - polyoxymethylene. This plastic determines the entire construction, from the chassis to the motor to the turntable. The platter is an impressive six centimeters thick and comes with a precisely fitting weight, also made of POM. The result is an audiophile appearance that is as cohesive as it is aesthetic.'
