        text: "The io uses\_the same power amplifier and phono stage as its larger brother, the multi-award winning\_Brio. The io aims to deliver exceptional sound quality\_in a smaller and more cost effective package.\_The class A/B circuit shares its DNA with the rest of Rega’s amplifiers, and as usual, great care has been taken in component selection. Sanken output transistors and an Alps volume potentiometer and a linear power supply that enables an output of 30 watts per channel into 8 ohms."

        text: "Two line level inputs and a high quality moving magnet phono input are available as sources.\_There is a headphone output provided on the front of the unit for powering standard hi-fi headphones; this is driven from the power amplifier stage of the unit through relays to avoid signal degradation when headphones are inserted or the product is muted.\_A new remote handset is included as well."
