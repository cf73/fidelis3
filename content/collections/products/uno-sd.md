        text: 'We started producing our first UNO model in 1991. Through continuous development and our quest for perfect sound and the perfect musical experi‐ ence, each generation of the UNO design has pushed the boundaries of performance. The G3 Series is absolutely unique in its combina‐ tion of innovative technologies. Driver systems which have been meticulously perfectionated during the past 30 years and have been brought to an outstanding level of perfection. Combined with a totally controlled probagation of the sound waves from the membranes to the listener. Drivers and spherical horn resulting in specification of 107dB at 18 Ohms. Absolutely amazing.'
