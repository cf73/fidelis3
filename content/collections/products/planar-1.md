quote: 'Probably the finest test of any product is how long we use it once having already come to our conclusion. In this case, the Planar 1 is still playing and proving it can turn its hand to Dmitri Shostakovich as adeptly as it does Toots and the Maytals or Charlie Parker.'

        text: "The new Planar\_1 is the most user friendly Rega turntable to date. Now with preset bias force\_on the brand new RB110 tonearm, the Planar\_1 is set up in seconds after unpacking. Simply\_slide the balance weight onto the rear of the tonearm as far as it will go, remove the stylus guard and start spinning your favorite vinyl. Every single aspect of the Planar 1\_has been meticulously\_designed to improve performance. For the first time\_the Planar 1 is now running a 24v, low noise, synchronous\_motor to reduce vibration transfer\_combined with our brand new RB110 tonearm\_fitted with Rega's\_bespoke ultra low friction play bearings. Only\_sharing the drive belt, sub platter and dust cover\_from\_the outgoing RP1, this is truly a new turntable from the ground up. If you are\_looking to get back into vinyl and want serious performance that will last you a\_lifetime, then look no\_further. The Planar 1 comes complete with a Carbon MM cartridge. "
