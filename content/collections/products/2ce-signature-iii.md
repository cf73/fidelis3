quote: 'In fact, the Model 2 is the best-selling audiophile loudspeaker of the modern era, with more than 100,000 pairs sold—all of them made in the U.S. That the Model 2 is still enjoying robust sales more than 40 years after its introduction is a testament to the speaker’s fundamental rightness of design and sound quality.'

        text: "In constant production since 1977 due to unprecedented popular demand, Vandersteen Audio's Model 2 is among the most wildly successful speakers in history. Well over 100,000 pairs of Model 2s have been sold in that span, a striking number of which are still listened to and cherished every day by real-world music lovers who still believe its performance-driven value proposition is as good as it gets for them. Timeless classics like the Model 2 have staying power because the designer stayed true to a vision. For the Model 2 that is sonic \"dimensional purity\".\_ \_"
