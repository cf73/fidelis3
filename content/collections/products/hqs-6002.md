        text: "The JMF Audio HQS power amplifiers have been acclaimed for their high output power combined with a faithful, natural rendering of music. Since 1988, the most influential audio professionals, such as American studio designer Tom Hidley, and world-class studios (Nashville, New-York, London, Capri, Tokyo, Moscow, Toulouse, Paris...) have trusted the HQS power amplifiers to monitor the quality of the recordings and productions, with great pleasure of listening.\_"

Being an expert engineer in high-frequency, infra-red and power electronics, Jean-Marie Fusilier approached audio differently, by passion, with pragmatism, and developed innovative solutions. These set the fundamentals of the make JMF Audio, established in 1985.\_"

        text: 'The JMF Audio founder desired a lively yet controlled rendering for all types of musics... Even with high sensitivity loudspeakers, this meant significant driving force, precision and very low noise floor. The tube technology which he used to cherish was therefore left aside. Regarding the solid state technology, it was common belief that only a pair of matched output transistors could lead to musicality, which was still only suitable for intimistic listening.'
