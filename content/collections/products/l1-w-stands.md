        text: 'The membrane in the Axxess ribbon tweeter is in Kapton – which is a very lightweight material. Compared to a dome tweeter it is 25 times lighter and due to the ribbon tweeter principle, the area is two times bigger. Our ribbon tweeter technology ensures a more immersive listening experience, bringing you closer to the music.'
