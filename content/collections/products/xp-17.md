quote: 'Bracketed by a record player on one side and a preamp on the other, the phono stage’s role is to be invisible—to convey the signal with minimal commentary while letting the music prevail in all its detail and emotion. I can’t really think of a more fitting way to describe what the splendid Pass Labs XP-17 does.'
