        text: 'With two prime DACs, we yield an unprecedented level of detail, reproducing the musicality, soundstage, and texture of an original performance, bringing the artist to you. A fully balanced, ultra-high precision, discrete ladder DAC architecture ensures each note tells a story. Additionally, MSB’s robust in-house design enables the finest quality playback of PCM and native DSD, while our low impedance circuitry drives your amplification directly without adding coloration or buffering noise. The end result is a digital experience defying expectations.'

            text: "The first three letters of this 25-year-old family business stand for 'Most Significant Bit' and how well this name fits with their products is proven by the now legendary MSB Reference and Select D / A converters.\_Truly beautiful machines that have moved the state-of-the-art a lot further, but are also extremely expensive.\_To accommodate the less wealthy music lover while retaining many of these qualities, MSB has released the Discrete DAC."
