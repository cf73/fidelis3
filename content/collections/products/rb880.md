        text: "A brand new low mass precision engineered vertical bearing assembly has been\_manufactured\_to further complement the inherent design philosophy of the\_Planar 8\_turntable. The\_RB880\_uses the latest\_Rega\_arm tube. Completely redesigned to redistribute mass and further reduce stresses and\_resonances. This advanced design tube increases the stiffness and rigidity of the overall assembly using CAD design to blend the multiple varying tapers."

        text: "Externally we have fitted a bespoke\_Rega\_designed low capacitance\_phono\_cable. Which uses an advanced\_phono\_plug assembly. This has only two parts to\_minimize\_joints and incorporates a twist and clamp design locking the plug to the terminal. The design increases connectivity and ensures the signal path is kept as clean as possible."

            text: 'The new RB880 arm is an evolution of the older RB330. Looking at it from the side you can see a new stainless/aluminum composite vertical bearing housing that is said to greatly improved performance. The arm uses low tolerance, hand-adjusted Japan-sourced ABEC bearings. No you cannot adjust azimuth but you can adjust VTA/SRA using either individual spacers between arm and plinth (which necessitates removing the arm) or the ingenious Acoustic Signature integrated spacers, which only requires that you loosen the 3 arm mounting bolts and slip one of the available thickness spacers, between the plinth and arm and then tighten. Or, you can remove the standard issue Rega dust attracting felt mat and use a thinner one to “raise” VTA/SRA or a thinner one to “lower” it!'
