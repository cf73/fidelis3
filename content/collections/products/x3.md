        text: 'The Børresen X series loudspeakers are not only a new entry-level into the Børresen universe, but also represents a real revolution in quality and performance in its price range. These speakers are created based on all the knowledge collected in the process of the creation of the M, 0 and Z-series. You´ll find components from these exclusive series in this Børresen X series loudspeakers – for instance the brand new Spread-tow carbon membrane, the highly praised Børresen ribbon tweeter and the use of copper caps in the magnetic motor system.'
