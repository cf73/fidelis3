        text: "Acora loudspeakers will reveal many things you simply haven’t heard before.\_What you won’t hear is the enclosure. Acora Acoustics loudspeakers are constructed using handcrafted, specially treated, natural granite enclosures. The rigidity of granite far exceeds that of traditional particle board or wood enclosures. One of the benefits of this is, as the SRC-2’s drivers move to push air / create sound, the enclosure isn’t absorbing this energy, dulling or smearing the sound. Another benefit of the Acora enclosure is that it does not need internal bracing to “stiffen” the enclosure. This means that internal cross bracing is not required. No internal bracing means no additional reflections inside the enclosure that will vibrate the low frequency drivers."
