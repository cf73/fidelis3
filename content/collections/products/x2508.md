        text: "This stereo class A/B model represents a step up in power and performance from the X150.8 and, like all of our products, has been painstakingly designed, tweaked, redesigned and fine-tuned to deliver maximum musical enjoyment. This hard work and creativity results in a greater “look-back” at the original musical performance, conveying additional insight to the artist’s creative intent. Isn't that what it's all about?"
