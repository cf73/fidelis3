        text: 'The MG2.7i’s are a pair of 3-way, full-range, Magneplanar loudspeakers. Both the Bass and Midrange sections are comprised of aluminum foil. Often referred to as “quasi-ribbon,” the foil is adhered to the Mylar diaphragm which is visible through the front of the fabric cover. The True Ribbon Tweeter is also comprised of aluminum foil however it is not mounted to a substrate but rather suspended freely. The MG2.7i’s reproduce sound by introducing an AC signal to: the conductor foil on the diaphragm which reacts to the fixed array of magnet strips mounted behind the Mylar; and the tweeter foil which reacts to the magnet channels on either side of it. This reaction vibrates the diaphragm/foil projecting sound as a dipole, both forward and backward.'

        text: "This model is available in both the standard and the premium 'X' versions. The general idea is to take the existing design of a given speaker, and simply, almost one-for-one, replace all of the components leading up to the driver, with superior ones.\_\_ This yields a noticeable, graphable, and customer-awing improvement.\_\_ Up to this point, every person who has received an “X” upgraded speaker, or even their unmarked predecessors and early partial upgrades and tests, has provided glowing reviews.\_ Thus far the program has been unanimously well received across the board.\_ There are certain model-specific features, but the MG___X Upgrade Program is at its core characterized by the following factors:"
