The format of a rear-ported 5” bass unit (in this case naturally the famous Falcon B110) and a ¾” dome tweeter is well known to produce excellent results from smaller cabinets.'

        text: "“So I suggested we do an homage to Stewart, it was something I wanted to do, the Tablette 50 was the first speaker I built at ProAc in 1996 just after I started there. It’s a classic small British loudspeaker and uses well-established design principles with a 5” woofer and ¾” tweeter.\_ So, Jerry and I agreed we would build a small number of speakers based upon the same format of a rear-ported 5” bass unit (in this case naturally the famous Falcon B110) and a ¾” dome tweeter. We have used the same SEAS 19TFF tweeter, it’s still made and it does exactly what it says on the tin”"
