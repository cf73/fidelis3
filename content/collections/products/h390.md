        text: "The H400 is a Class AB amplifier, delivering 250W of power into 8 ohms, and is stable down to 2-ohm loads. With a remarkable damping factor of 4000, H400 ensures tight control over your speakers, providing precise and dynamic sound. H400's dual mono construction and symmetrical layout ensure superior sound quality. The absence of an equalizer preserves signal integrity, while our SoundEngine 2 technology offers instant distortion correction during amplification. This results in a detailed, agile sound, delivering both punch and finesse while maximizing power efficiency. Experience your favorite music with a new level of clarity and richness, as the H400 faithfully reproduces every nuance and detail."
