        text: 'Just below Gold Eclipse 10 in its preservation of musical details and dimensionality, Silver Eclipse 10 is a cable for listeners who demand high resolution, pristine tone quality and lifelike dynamics from their high-end component systems. Compared to the previous Silver Eclipse 8 cable, this cable has twice as many strand groups, for improved preservation of quiet information and wider dynamic contrasts. The upgraded COMPOSILEX 5 insulation and Grain-Optimized OCC-7N Silver-clad copper conductors provide a quieter background than previous materials. The patented DNA Helix cable design of this cable is instrumental in providing the most lifelike sound that OCC-7N Silver-clad copper can produce. Available with either XLR or RCA cable terminations and in custom lengths, the Wireworld Silver Eclipse 10 embodies excellence in audio signal transmission.'
