          systems, integrated amplifiers, preamps, power amps, tuners, receivers, and
          turntables purchased new at Fidelis may be traded in for like items, costing at
          least twice as much as the original unit. 100% of the original price may be
          applied as long as the unit retains original packing, boxes, instructions and
          proof of purchase. The unit traded in must be in excellent working order and
          without cosmetic defects. This policy excludes phono cartridges or other items that are subject to usage-related wear and performance deterioration.

          Fidelis
          may, at its sole discretion, loan certain demo equipment to local customers for
          limited home use. There may be a per diem charge for the use of such equipment
          that will be credited towards the purchase of equipment from Fidelis. The
          customer assumes full responsibility for returning the equipment in good
          working order and without damage, within the agreed time period. Equipment home trial is not available outside of our immediate geographic region and products may not be shipped for either delivery or return.

          Fidelis
          is a warranty service center for some of the manufacturers we carry, however
          certain manufacturers require us to send all warranty repairs to them. In these
          cases all shipping charges to the manufacturer are the responsibility of the
          customer. (Most manufacturers will pay for return shipping.) All manufacturers’
          warranties apply and are the responsibility of the manufacturer.
