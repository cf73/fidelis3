        text: 'Under new ownership, but still producing the extremely musical sound their electronics are known for, we are delighted to now offer one of the industries preeminent brands in tubed electronics. Founded in the mid 1970''s, Conrad Johnson, along with ARC ruled the tube roost for over 30 years. We had been hearing such glowing praise on the new range of amps and preamps from our dealer friends across the country that we decided it was time to join the CJ revolution!'
