        text: 'Avantgarde - renowned for their high-efficiency horn-loaded designs. We feel that Avantgarde has a truly unique sound and aesthetic that will appeal to those that value life-like dynamics and low-level detail as well as a 3-dimensional image field where despite their majestic size, the speakers completely disappear! A perfect match with some of our low-powered tubed amplifier option (such as Airtight).

        text: 'Borresen - a premium speaker line from Denmark, the new "X" series offers both incredible performance and value. Most folks that we played these for a. love the sound and b. think the speakers sell for double or more of their actual retail price. Using proprietary ribbon tweeters and an innovative venting system, the X-Series from Borresen is truly a "giant killer" of a speaker!'
