        text: 'Classic Legend employs improved metallurgy - G9 is the 9th generation of Siltech’s proprietary silver-gold alloy with up to 2 times larger conductors than previous generations. This new range uses the company’s new G9 silver-gold conductors, the latest in a long line starting with the G1 which was a 99.99% pure solid silver wire found in the first cables. Silver boasts the best conductivity of any metal, and this actually improves over time. The new G9 wire alloys silver and gold together to fill in the micro-cracks of the crystal structure, as well as offering improved cable run-in.'
