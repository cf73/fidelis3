        text: 'We had heard the scuttlebutt around the industry and from associates who had attended various trade shows, but our nature is to be cautious and to avoid the "hype". It literally took 5 minutes after insertion into our reference system for the Grimm Audio MU1 to acquit itself as a superior music streaming device. We are looking forward to the next addition to the Grimm Audio line-up - the MU2, which incorporates an on-board DAC, analog inputs and analog volume control. '

            text: 'We wanted to develop the most accurate audio source we could imagine. In our experience, the human hearing system shows an incredible sensitivity to anomalies. Even unimaginably small aberrations appear to be audible. In principle, digital audio does offer perfect reproduction. Its sonic quality, however, is limited by the implementation accuracy of the physical and mathematical laws that affect the conversion from one format to another. Grimm Audio strives to bring you confidence that all technical details are taken care of to the greatest extent so that the reproduction system steps out of the way of the music.'

            text: 'With the MU1, our goal was to set a new benchmark in music player design. The Linux-based computer system brings solid data integrity. Our in-house-designed FPGA interface board, which forms the heart of the MU1, offers breakthrough performance levels in format conversion and receives automatic updates whenever we have pushed the boundaries again. Needless to say, the MU1 features our trademark ultra-low jitter clock. This is a music player worthy of the name Grimm Audio.'
