        text: 'When Audio Research was founded in 1970 by Bill Johnson, he had one goal in mind: to advance the state-of-the-art in music reproduction. Today, Audio Research remains true to its roots as a performance-oriented company driven by proven philosophies and superior design. Many industry observers consider Audio Research one of the true originators of the concept of “high-end” audio, offering an unsurpassed level of performance that can easily be heard and appreciated by all.'

        text: 'Over its first half-century, Audio Research has grown from a small operation in the back of Bill’s shop to a modern, self-contained factory with dedicated R&D, testing, manufacturing, quality control, and listening facilities. Manufacturing is done by hand in-house, from the ground up, in our Minnesota facility. (Contact us for a tour if you are near Minneapolis, it’s fascinating to meet the people and see the process in action.)'
