title: 'Fleetwood Loudspeaker DeVille now on display!'
image: deville-4317b-5-scaled.jpg
summary: 'Basically, the DeVille is like having a concert at home - you can turn up the volume far beyond any comparable loudspeaker. Because when you want them to be loud they need very little power and they don’t run out of steam.'
main_content: '<p>The DeVille loudspeaker is an extremely high quality, compact, two way design made from sustainably harvested, solid Pennsylvania ash hardwood that has been torrefied (thermally treated for tone and stability.) It is the most powerful and efficient design possible for its size, using real professional drivers capable of much lower distortion and higher power handling.&nbsp; We can provide a range of excellent options for an amplifier, but just about any amplifier will run the DeVille’s - from low powered tube to high power solid state. We are finding them to be a spectacular match with our Lab12 electronics - come on in and give a listen - we think you will agree!</p>'
