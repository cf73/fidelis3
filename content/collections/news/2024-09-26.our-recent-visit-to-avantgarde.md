        text: 'Avantgarde has been making exceptional speakers for over 20 years and their newest versions have raised the bar once again! They set the standard for horn-loaded speakers and in doing so, they also challenge the best of conventional dynamic speakers in the areas where horn-loaded speakers are normally weaker. Sure, they have incredible high level dynamics and detail, but their sound is also smooth and refined with none of the typical horn "shoutiness" and bright upper frequencies. The resolution of low-level detail and micro-dynamics is unrivaled and when set-up properly, the speakers disappear into an incredible 3-dimensional soundstage. The build quality is superb and fit and finish is state of the art. As good as our demo speakers sound, we now have a few tips and technics to elevate their performance further still. We are excited about the new Zero Uno model as well as the entry-level Colibri and will be displaying those as soon as they are available. '
