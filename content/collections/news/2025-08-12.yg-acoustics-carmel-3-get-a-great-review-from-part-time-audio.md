        text: 'By the end of the review period, I had come to the simple conclusion that the YG Acoustics Carmel 3 loudspeakers might be my absolute favorites from this company. It’s not because they provide the best sound among the copious YG lines–I’ve heard the spectacular XV3s a couple of times now, a massive four-tower system that costs about a half-million dollars, and they produced the most realistic and complete soundstage I’ve ever experienced. But aside from ultimate bass extension, the Carmels sound so much like the bigger and more expensive YGs that they might be the perfect transducer for smaller rooms. (That said, my listening room is large and the Carmels did not leave me wanting for more size and scope.)'

        text: 'The Carmels, like so many of my favorite hi-fi components, force you to realize that many of your preconceptions about audio are misguided at best. They are small and they are expensive, but they are also worth every penny because they simply accomplish so much. The imaging and sound staging is spectacular, the tonality is natural and honest and neutral, and an honest 32 Hz is certainly all I need–especially when the goose bumps are so easily and consistently evoked. After so many years with these speakers occupying a space in the back of my brain, I feel lucky that we met and my expectations were surpassed. Highly recommended.'
