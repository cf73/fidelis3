        text: 'We had been looking for some time to find an audiophile-quality DAC that sounded musical, was well built and didn''t break the bank. On suggestion of a dealer friend, we reached out to Merason for a sample and it was love at first sight! Couple the Frerot with its companion POW1 linear power supply and you have a heavyweight performer for the lightweight price of $2,250.00.'
