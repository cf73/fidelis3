        text: 'It was great to see some old friends and make some new ones, and to hear from the folks at McIntosh and Sonus Faber. This was our first in-house seminar since the outbreak of COVID, but we look forward to doing more in the near future -- stay tuned, and let us know if there are events that would be of special interest to you!'
