        text: 'Our design philosophy is the culmination of more than 40 years of research and development. Conrad-Johnson products are executed with simple circuits, constructed with the highest-quality custom components. Our products benefit from the use of proprietary components (CJD film capacitors, audio and power transformers), military-grade parts (precision audio resistors), and in-house designed elements (circuit boards, chassis and dress metal)—all sourced from North American vendors.'
