        text: 'To reach that goal, we continually strive to design amplifiers that deliver great sound, measure well and are reliable. This is achieved through ongoing R&D, and lots and lots of listening. Oscilloscopes and distortion analyzers are excellent tools, but they historically make lousy customers. Our real customers care most about the experience they get when they sit down to listen to their music.'
