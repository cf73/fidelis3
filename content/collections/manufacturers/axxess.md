        text: 'Based on the innovative technological development and design traditions of Ansuz, Aavik and Børresen, Axxess will manufacture, high-quality loudspeakers, amplifiers, and audio cables, that Audio Group Denmark’s dealers can sell at a more modest price than the Ansuz, Aavik and Børresen equipment, and yet some that will attain the standard of musical performance and aesthetic design for which Ansuz, Aavik and Børresen is famous.'
