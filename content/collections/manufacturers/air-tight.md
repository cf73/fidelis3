        text: 'In the past 60 years, 30 with Luxman and 30 with Air Tight, I have been fortunate to witness the transformation of our industry. From the beginning with vacuum tube amplification to solid-state and the concept of analog playback to digital, all in the pursuit and re-creation of the musical experience.'

        text: 'It is a supreme honor for me to be included in The Absolute Sounds “Hall of Fame” and I will continue to contribute so long as I live, to the reproduction of high quality music. That is my promise and commitment. There is a saying in Japan, that when one reaches the age of 80, one receives an invitation from another world. And I always reply, “It is too early as I still have many tasks to achieve.”'
