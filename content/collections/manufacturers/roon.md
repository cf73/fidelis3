        text: "At the heart of every Roon system is a Roon Core. This is the brain behind the entire Roon experience â€“ it manages your music collection, streams to your audio devices, and stores the Roon database. Nucleus was developed by the Roon team to provide a silent, high-performance, power-efficient appliance to host the Roon Core. Every aspect of the hardware, operating system, and software is optimized to make Nucleus the very best way to run Roon-by the same team who made Roon.\_\_"
