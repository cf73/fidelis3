        text: "When Siltech began manufacturing cables back in 1983, few knew that hi-fi systems only sound as good as the wires that connect them. Since then, our research has driven the development of the finest interconnects, speaker cables and power leads that money can buy.\_Silver was chosen to achieve this rarefied level of performance, due to its excellent signal transfer characteristics."
