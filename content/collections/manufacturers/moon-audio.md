        text: 'With MOON, you don’t just listen to music, you live it. Feel it. From the first note, the experience transcends. Transforms. There is a newfound level of intimacy between you and the artist. That’s the MOON promise: a privileged access to the intention and the purity of sound. The fingertip on the guitar string, the sharp inhale between two notes, the amplitude and impact of silence. You are front row center to every sound; every sentiment. MOON takes you to the epicenter and truth of sound – to its very soul.'
