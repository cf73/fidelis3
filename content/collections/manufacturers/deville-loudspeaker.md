description: '<p>The DeVille loudspeaker is an extremely high quality, compact, two way design made from sustainably harvested, solid Pennsylvania ash hardwood that has been torrefied (thermally treated for tone and stability.) It is the most powerful and efficient design possible for its size, using real professional drivers capable of much lower distortion and higher power handling.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>'
