description: '<p>McIntosh MR-78 tuner in excellent condition w/wood case. The unit powers/lights up and we have verified functionality. I would assume that the buyer would want to send back to McIntosh for cleaning and re-calibration. No original box and packing available. This is one of the most iconic FM tuners that was ever made and highly sought after - sound quality is both surprising and exceptional with a good signal.. Physical condition is as good as I have seen for this age with just a bit of corrosion on the cage and aging on the back panel and connectors (which is normal).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>'
