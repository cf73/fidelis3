description: '<p>Acurus A-150 amplifier in rare (excellent) condition with original box and packing. A one-owner piece that was well cared for and sold as new for $700.00. Acurus was the step-down (budget) line from Aragon, designed by Dan D''Agostino from Krell fame and it punched way above its weight in performance.&nbsp;</p>'
