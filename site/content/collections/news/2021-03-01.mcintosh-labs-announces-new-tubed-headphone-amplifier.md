summary: 'The MHA200 Vacuum Tube Headphone Amplifier is designed for discerning headphone enthusiasts who demand the most from their headphones.'
main_content: '<p>A pair of 12AT7 and 12BH7A dual triode vacuum tubes power the compact MHA200. The 12AT7 vacuum tubes amplify the incoming audio signal while the 12BH7A tubes provide the power to drive the output to your headphones with low distortion. The MHA200 uses a pair of our Unity Coupled Circuit output transformers to deliver pristine audio to your ears. Our Unity Coupled Circuit is the same technology McIntosh was founded on in 1949 and is still used in our vaunted full-size home audio vacuum tube amplifiers such as the timeless&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mcintoshlabs.com/products/amplifiers/MC275B">MC275</a>&nbsp;and the more recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mcintoshlabs.com/products/amplifiers/MC1502">MC1502</a>. Indeed, the MHA200 shares many physical design traits with the aforementioned vacuum tube amplifiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A wide assortment of connectivity options come on the MHA200. For attaching your headphones, there are 3 options: a pair of 3-pin balanced XLR connectors for dedicated Left and Right balanced output; a 4-pin balanced XLR connector for balanced stereo output; and a 1/4" stereo headphone jack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The MHA200 takes advantage of unique McIntosh technologies to create the best possible personal listening experience. The Unity Coupled Circuit transformers have been adapted to produce 4 headphone impedance ranges of 32 – 100, 100 – 250, 250 – 600, and 600 – 1,000 Ohms at 500mW so that virtually every headphone can receive legendary McIntosh sound quality and performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
