quote: 'Our first listening session with the first playing pair of Heritage Specials was meant to last 20 minutes. It ended more than two hours later. I think that says everything you need to know about these speakers.'

description: '<p>"Heritage Special"&nbsp; isn’t just a name. It’s a salute to traditional high-performance Danish audio design. And each of the 2500 limited-edition pairs is unique.</p><p>Listen to craftsmanship. Listen to real wood. Listen to state-of-the-art, hand-built tweeters and woofers. To more than 2000 hours of devoted R&amp;D. To the depths of your record collection. Listen to what you love.</p><p>Heritage Special is brimming with the spirit (and full boldness) that made the Dynaudio name – plus some new surprises. Run your fingers over the hand-finished American Walnut finish. Discover the meticulously crafted joins and corners of the individually selected – and individually matched ­– veneer panels. Pause at the signature groove surrounding the baffle (you’ll remember it from the Dynaudio speakers you coveted years ago).</p><p>And then put the top-of-the-line Esotar 3 tweeter and souped-up Evidence woofer through their paces with something that’ll rock your socks off.</p><p>We made Heritage Special for&nbsp;<em>you</em>.</p>'
