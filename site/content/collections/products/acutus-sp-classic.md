description: '<p><b>Acutus</b>&nbsp;turntable is radically different from current design theories. Designed from a clean sheet, leaving nothing unexplored or unresolved. Setting a standard of musical reproduction others aspire to achieve. In brief, this is a belt drive, sprung subchassis design and this is where similarity with other designs stops. On first appearance you can see there is something different and you would be right.<br><br>Vibration caused by the stylus during playback is transmitted to the subchassis directly through our newly revised unique single point&nbsp;<a href="http://www.avidhifi.com/bearing.htm">bearing</a>&nbsp;and not absorbed into the platter. This is achieved using a unique matting material and clamping system. External vibrations are isolated by a unique variable frequency suspension system, conveniently adjustable from above.<br><br>A purpose designed power supply, incorporating our latest DSP signal generation makes for accurate speed settings. This coupled to a unique hand made motor, 10 times more powerful than normally used, drives a massive 10Kg platter with our new&nbsp;<a href="http://www.avidhifi.com/images/twin.jpg" rel="lightbox">twin belt</a>&nbsp;drive system making for excellent speed stability and sonic pictures of sound.<br><br>Stunningly finished in Polished Chrome, this product is the natural choice of equipment for those who demand the best.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
