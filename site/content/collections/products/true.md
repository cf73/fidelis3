description: '<p>Everyone in high-end audio is familiar with the straight gain concept – the best amplifier is a cable with gain. It’s the most pure, unaltered way of signal delivery that adds none of its own signature and keeps the flow of music untouched and unadulterated.<br>Nothing keeps the level of micro and macro details intact as passive preamplifiers and our Lab12 True can transfer the musical energy with feather-like lightness and uncompromising dynamic impact at the same time – a fine balancing act few manage to achieve.<br>True was designed as a superlative passive, high-end audio hub that offers users multiple inputs and an ultra- transparent, yet musical volume control.<br>As with all Lab12 products, True comes with a glass blasting anodizing finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
