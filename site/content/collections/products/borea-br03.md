description: '<ul><li>A bookshelf design to be placed on a dedicated stand, the Borea BR03 is equipped with a 25mm EFS silk dome tweeter and a 16cm midrange/bass driver. The untreated cellulose paper membrane, developed for the Esprit EZ series, confers a natural sound with no coloration. The vocal range keeps all its intensity and the low frequencies their usual dynamism without ever generating listening fatigue. This size is especially recommended for dedicated listeners looking for the performance of a floorstander in a compact design. From the very first notes, the BR03 impresses with its energy, delivery of deep notes and power handling. This speaker will fit perfectly in rooms ranging from 15 to 30 cubic feet.</li></ul>'

    excerpt: '<p>It’s not often we stumble across a pair of speakers at this price that sound as sophisticated as the Triangle Borea BR03s.</p><p>For the money, they’re savvy musical performers with a great sense of scale and an even greater appetite for presenting music in a transparent and mature manner. But are they speakers capable of worrying the current class-leaders? Most definitely.</p>'
