We have employed the same optimised elastomer used in the Diva II giving excellent mechanical isolation of the playing surface, resulting in better information retrieval and resolution.<br><br><b>Ingenium Plug&amp;Play</b>&nbsp;offers people the chance of opening a window to quality audiophile vinyl reproduction, without feeling its&nbsp;<em>"just another turntable"</em><br><br>It''s reassuringly an AVID turntable at an affordable price.<br></p>'

    excerpt: '<p>Tonally, the Ingenium was a pleasingly smooth performer with an evenhanded balance, somewhat rich in the midrange but notably free of a mid bass bump type coloration sometimes found in ‘tables below $2500. Some ‘tables avoid the bump or a low frequency resonance produced by excess energy that the chassis is unable to absorb, by curtailing the very bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
