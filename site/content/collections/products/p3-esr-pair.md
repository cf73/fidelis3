    excerpt: '<p>The Harbeth P3ESR is one of those rare audio components that, within its obvious limitations, gives no other indication that it has been compromised. Yes, I did much of my auditioning with the budget-priced Peachtree iDecco integrated amplifier, but before the accident happened with the right speaker, I was using the Harbeths with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stereophile.com/hirezplayers/dcs_puccini_sacd_playback_system">dCS Puccini</a>&nbsp;SACD player and DAC ($22,000), the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stereophile.com/solidpreamps/1106sim">Simaudio Moon Evolution P-8</a>&nbsp;preamp ($12,000), and Classé CTM-600 monoblocks ($16,000/pair), all connected with expensive AudioQuest Wild cables. The P3ESRs did not sound outclassed in this system, merely restricted in loudness and bass extension.</p><p>I love the Harbeth P3ESR. I think it''s the best iteration yet from any manufacturer of the BBC LS3/5A minimonitor concept.</p><p><br></p>'
