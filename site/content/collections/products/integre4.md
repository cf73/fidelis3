    excerpt: '<p>&nbsp; “..All in all, the Lab12 Integre4 was a thoroughly excellent-sounding integrated amplifier. Its powerful, punchy, dynamic sound was a treat for the ears, and its fine timing did justice to all genres of music. . . .Throw in its user-friendly interface, its large, easy-to-read display, and its ability to accept many different tube types, and the Integre4 might be the most versatile, well-rounded tube amp anywhere near its price…”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
