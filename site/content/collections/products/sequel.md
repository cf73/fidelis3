    excerpt: '<p>Those who want LP''s to sound like CD and/or SACD in terms of neutrality and clarity will find the Sequel SP exceptional. It allows you to experience the best vinyl has to offer, while minimizing most of the downsides. LP''s on the Sequel SP exhibit a free, airy, spacious clarity you never get from silver disc. The precision and focus of CD is there, but without that dry and clinical quality you also get.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
