description: '<p>This is a musical and visual expression of our Integrated amplifier range, plundering its stablemate for its internal building blocks.</p><p>Offering an impressive sound quality that obvious from the first few moments, suddenly you escape into a soundstage you didn''t expect to find in your music collection.</p><p>Powering your music is a huge transformer, electrical reservoir and the mono amplifiers from our SIGSUM. Avoiding unwanted circuitry noise which tarnishes the sound, we have harnessed a silky-smooth ALPS volume control and bespoke capacitors from our Reference models offering a warmth that makes listening an endless pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>From inception a multitude of Industry accolades have been bestowed on this musical amplifier, connecting you vividly to the performance, either through the built in Pellar phono-stage or its numerous line inputs. Listening with loudspeakers opens up a glorious soundstage and for those moments of solitude you have the exceptional headphone output. A winning design that is also winning hearts and awards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'
