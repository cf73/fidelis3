description: '<p>At last, there is a solution for listeners with smaller living spaces or more efficient systems. Those who want a truly high-performance amplifier in a more manageable package. There are systems and locations where larger amps simply don’t fit or more powerful options are unnecessary and the 1161 Stereo Power Amplifier was developed as a compact, less powerful alternative that gives up nothing in terms of performance. The dynamics, the control, the delicacy, the resolution–everything is still there. There are no sonic drawbacks. The 1161 has the same operational feature set as its larger brother, the&nbsp;<a href="http://boulderamp.com/products/1160-stereo-power-amplifier/">1160</a>, and yet it’s packaged in a chassis the that’s same width and depth as the&nbsp;<a href="http://boulderamp.com/products/1110-stereo-preamplifier/">1110 Preamplifier</a>. So you see, it is possible to have everything, even with less.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'

    type: Review
    excerpt: '<p><strong>Excellence defined</strong></p><p>In a world where countless hi-fi reviews lead to a conclusion where the reviewer says, “Is the XYZ amplifier worth the price asked? I don’t know, I can’t make that decision,” I have no reservation saying the Boulder 1161 is one of the best values in high-end audio today. On their website, Boulder says that the 1161 “has no sonic drawbacks.” For a change, the product exceeds the manufacturers claim.</p><p>And that’s what you write the check for. Given the Boulder 1161s sonic performance, build quality, and that it is as obsolescence proof as a component can be, I find it to be a more than worthy candidate for one of our Exceptional Value Awards for 2019. If you seek what Boulder offers, there is no better. And if you don’t need the raw power of the 2000 or 3000 series, this amplifier can easily be the last one you ever buy. Unless of course, you get a hankering for a bigger Boulder…</p>'
