    excerpt: '<p>These Super HL5+ were&nbsp;perfect for almost every style and genre of music I listened to, or cared to listen to. The immediacy and intimacy were pure electrostat. The size and impact was clearly dynamic. Very few speakers do both of them well. Just add appropriate levels of power, and you’re all done.&nbsp;Better still, they’ll grow with you — the more you improve the gear feeding them, the more you’ll hear out of them. A gift that keeps on giving. As it was to your parents, so will a pair of Super HL5+ be&nbsp;to you — and to your kids.</p>'
