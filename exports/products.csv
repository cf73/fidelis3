Every aspect of Gamma cable system performance simply flows with the ease and clarity of a single voice. Textural and tonal nuance is balanced perfectly against Gamma's explosive, dynamic nature. Gamma cable systems never sound forward, bright, aggressive or edgy. However, what truly separates Gamma cables from all others, regardless of cost, is their self-effacing alacrity, timing accuracy, dynamic punch and frequency extension. Most pure-copper cables, even expensive models, may sound warm, rich, and full bodied at the expense of accurate timing, dynamics and frequency extension. Gamma cables sound very natural, but are surprisingly agile, athletic and entirely unforced with regard to expressing frequency extension, timing, weight and authority in the low octaves. Gamma cables do all of this without calling attention to themselves, allowing the purity of the sound to take center stage.""",,"'Gamma NR, 1.75M'",text,1743258696,87ca4130-78f3-4ed1-8b64-aa552d3d08a8

The balanced connection issue was looming out there as a monstrous obstacle to the wide adoption of this technology and I congratulate Ron Sutherland for stepping up to the plate and solving the problem.
